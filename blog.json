      "description": "how to insall and root ur phone ( xiomi 8 in this case ) using magisk and install lineageos too, p much it",
      "content": "_( probably works with other redmis too, but ull have to change some shit with firmware and whatnot )_\n\ni recently rooted my phone and installed lineageos so making this guide i guess\n( huge credits to ducky, a person on the linux gang discord server, who has helped me a lot through all of this )\n\n**warning** thill will void ur warranty and this worked for me, i cannot guarantee anything for ur device, make sure both magisk and lineageos support ur device\n\n-   lineageos supported devices : <https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/>\n-   magisk supported devices : theres no such list, but if lineageos supports it ur probably good, although i would recommend asking ai, looking stuff up and / or consulting others for guidance\n\nrequirements :\n\n-   at least 1 computer\n-   windows ( **required** for unlocking the bootloader )\n-   linux ( for everything else, although can b done on windows too, just easier on linux lol and as im a linux user this has more resources on that )\n-   a xiaomi redmi 8 phone which is [supported by lineageos](https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/Mi439/) ( this guide might work with other redmis, but u will have to make changes in firmware and stuff u download )\n\n( u might want to dualboot if u have access to a singular computer )\n\n**by reading further u take full responsibility for anything that might happen to ur device and want to see the tutorial**\n\n## abstract\n\nthis tutorial walks through the process of enabling developer options on a redmi 8 device,\nunlocking the bootloader using the official mi unlock tool, then\nthrough the process of installing lineageos through recovery,\npatching the boot image using magisk and installing it so u can have a rooted lineageos system, i also\ncover the process of recovery in case of a failed installation\n\nthis guide is for redmi 8 mainly, although if ur using it as a resource for other redmis\nmake sure to change out redmi 8 specific parts like partition flashing, roms, etc\n\n## part one -- developer options\n\nfirst u will have to enable developer options before doing anything, u might\nhave to repeat this step multiple times during the process of this tutorial\n\n-   to to settings\n-   go to miui version\n-   spam click til it says 'u are now a developer'\n\nnow :\n\n-   go to settings home\n-   go to additional settings\n-   go to developer options\n-   enable OEM unlocking\n-   enable usb debugging\n\n## part two -- host machine setup\n\ni personally used linux for most of this process, but i did have to use windows on my stepfathers laptop\nfor unlocking the bootloader ( mentioned below ), stuff u will need is simple\n\n-   adb\n-   fastboot\n\nthese tools are usually available as `android-tools` in linux, for example\n[the arch linux android-tools package](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/android-tools/)\non windows u will probably also require a few usb drivers, although i dont rlly have a clue,\non my stepfathers windows 10 pc i had to install\n\n-   the drivers from the mi unlock tool ( mentioned below ) by pressing 'install driver' button\n-   https://www.xiaomidriversdownload.com/xiaomi-usb-drivers-official/\n\nthen had to reboot the laptop\n\nbut at this step, if ur on windows, ull have to figure out what drivers u need and how to install\n`fastboot` and `adb`, everything else should work for both linux and windows\n\n## part three -- bootloader unlocking prep\n\n**edit : ducky ( a person on the linux gang server ) has figured out that <https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient#unlock-bootloader> can b used to unlock the bootloader and bypass the wait time, try it out if u wanna, works for all mediatek devices**\n\nxiaomi devices come with a locked bootloader, meaning u have to unlock them,\nin our case we will use the official [mi unlock tool which u can download here](https://en.miui.com/unlock/download_en.html)\nwhich is only available on windows, i have tried everything else, including ( but not limited to ) fucking around\nwith adb and the unofficial mi unlock tool, but nothing worked, so its best u just get\na laptop with windows or maybe a vm with usb passthrough, maybe find some better solution that works\non linux ( or ur setup ), but idk\n\nafter downloading the tool, run it and log into ur account using ur password and phone number\n( password will be required later so make sure to note it or something, make sure to not make it very\ncomplex because the password will be required to type by hand later ), if u dont have one, make sure\nto make one\n\nthen connect ur phone to ur pc using a usb connection and make sure to allow usb debugging when\nit prompts u to enable it\n\nthen open settings -> additional settings -> developer options and\npress on 'mi unlock status' and then :\n\n-   make sure u have a sim card inserted ( u have to keep it inserted always for it to unlock )\n-   turn off wifi and enable mobile data\n-   press add account and device\n\npress agree and follow the instructions\n\nthen u will have to wait a painful long while, at least a week if not longer,\nxiaomi **_really_** hates users who want to gain control of their device, it might be anywhere\nfrom a week to months, nobody knows, but all u have to do at this stage is\n\n-   not log out of the mi unlock tool ( yes u can close it, but not log out, logging out resets everything )\n-   wait\n-   check on it semi-weekly ( like every 1.5-2 weeks or so )\n\n### how do u know that u are legible for unlocking ?\n\nwell, just repeat the process of running the tool, connecting and whatnot\nand one day u will see that the 'unlock' button will b available\n\n## part four -- bootloader unlocking\n\nnow, as u can unlock the bootloader, dont jump straight into it, make sure :\n\n-   u know ur mi account password and it isnt so complex u cant type it by hand\n-   u have all ur data backed up ( this step will erase all data )\n-   u dont care about the warranty ( this step will void it )\n\nthen, if ur device is ready and all set, press 'unlock', this step shouldnt take long, it should\ngo by pretty quickly and then ull b booted into a stock rom basically\n\nwhen u boot into it, u will b prompted for ur mi account password to unlock ur phone,\nenter it and thats it, after this step u will have to repeat the enabling developer options\nstep again\n\n## part five -- lineageos installation\n\n**this part might fail, if it does, just see <#:recovery>**\n\nnow, as ur phone is fully unlocked and set up for lineageos, its time to flash it, for redmi 7a, 8, 8a and 8a dual\nthe rom download page is <https://download.lineageos.org/devices/Mi439/builds> so grab the latest build from there\nand extract it, also make sure to download `super_empty.img` from the builds page as its not included in the build zip\n\nnow, connect ur phone again with usb debugging enabled and fastboot it using this command\n( on windows ull probably have to use cmd.exe or powershell or something, not a clue ) :\n\n    adb reboot bootloader\n\nextract ur build ( make sure u still have the zip of the build saved, but do extract it ), `cd` into the\ndirectory, make sure u have the `super_empty.img`, then flash the needed partitions for installation through recovery :\n\n    fastboot flash dtbo dtbo.img\n    fastboot flash vbmeta vbmeta.img\n    fastboot wipe-super super_empty.img\n    fastboot flash recovery recovery.img\n    fastboot boot recovery.img\n\nif the `wipe-super` command is not found, make sure ur adb is up to date\n\nthese commands vary based on what firmware u have, always make sure to consult the lineageos wiki,\nfor example <https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/Mi439/install/variant2>\n\nthen using volume and power keys go to factory reset -> format data / factory reset and format\neverything, this will erase _everything_\n\nafter that go back to the home menu of the recovery, press 'apply update' and select 'apply from adb', then\nuse this command to fully install lineageos :\n\n    adb sideload lineage-<...>.zip\n\nthe zip is the one u downloaded from the builds page\n\nif something fails, try to flash the stock rom first, which is covered in <#:recovery>,\nafter it is all done, proceed to boot into lineageos\n\n## part six -- magisk installation ( rooting )\n\n**this part might fail, if it does, just see <#:recovery>**\n\nin the extracted lineageos zip there is a `boot.img` file, save it on ur phone using `adb push boot.img /path/on/to/phones/storage` or anything else\nu prefer and install the [latest magisk app from their releases by downloading the apk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases)\nthen open the magisk app, press install, check both 'patch vbmeta in boot image' and 'recovery mode'\ncheckboxes, press next, press select 'select and patch a file' or something, select the `boot.img`\nand patch it, after its done patching, transfer it back to ur computer using preferred method, i prefer\n`adb pull /path/on/to/phones/storage/magisk_patched-<...>.img .` personally\n\nnow fastboot ur phone again, making sure its still connected, then boot the patched image :\n\n    fastboot boot magisk_patched-<...>.img\n\nthis boot into rooted lineageos, when it boots, go into the magisk app, press 'install' and select 'direct install',\nwhen it asks for superuser access, allow it, then itll install\n\nafter it installs, u are now free to reboot into ur rooted lineageos system\n\n## part seven -- verifying root\n\nnow, after u boot into ur rooted system, verify it, go into magisk and see the 'superuser' tab, if its grayed out,\nur phone isnt rooted, if u can access it, then it is rooted, even then, not counting that in, in the 'install section'\nit should show that u have magisk installed and should show u the version of magisk installed\n\nif it didnt root, maybe proceed to repeat the rooting step or seek community support\n\nand if it did, ur done, enjoy ur new rooted lineageos system :)\n\n## recovery\n\nif lineageos is working, but u borked ur boot image, just fastboot and run this :\n\n    fastboot flash boot boot.img\n\nwhere `boot.img` is ur original boot image ( u can get it in the lineageos build zip ), then just reboot\n\nelse, if something failed and u only have fastboot access ( meaning u havent bricked ur phone ) its easily fixable :\n\n-   download default fastbot rom, for redmi 8 its <https://miuirom.org/phones/redmi-8#Global> ( older firmware -> fastboot ( currently 4.05 GB tgz file ) )\n-   extract the tgz using `tar xvf <filename>.tgz`\n-   `cd` into the directory\n-   make sure ur phone is connected through usb\n-   run `bash flash_all.sh`\n-   boot into stock rom\n\nand well, if ur phone is in a state where it wont even boot into fastboot, i have nothing to say, best of luck\ntrying to fix it :), a person told me <https://new.c.mi.com/global/post/460894> might b helpful in such state",

      "description": "doml #7 -- summer life, friends, regret, police and life",
      "content": "i have so much to talk about, i am so sorry i havent posted a doml in so long\n\nstart of the summer was pretty chill, i mainly spent it at home, doing nothing, when\none day a friend called me to go out to a concert i was not planning on going to, but\nafter rejecting it once he said 'come anyway' so well, i did, in that concert i donated\nsome money to some org and whatnot and then it was awkward after, although that friend\npicked a random person and basically made us converse, we bonded instantly, lets call\nher 'gzodis', gzodis and me shared a lot of same problems, doctors even, in general life\nstuff and we bonded over it, turns out her friend is also my crush and she knows a lot\nof mutuals and whatnot, gzodis then joined my friend grp, she was a good fit, it was fun\nbut thats where the lore starts\n\ngzodis is very extroverted and i am very introverted, meaning i had to adapt, we hung\nout basically daily and stuff, we did a fuckton of shit together, for example get high\ntogether, write a fuckton of shit under bridges and whatnot, many sentimental things like\nthat and genuinely i feel like shes my best friend even after like idk 2-3 months of knowing her\nas of today, she is genuinely amazing and we click together, although we do face issues\n\nfirst major thing that happened had police involved even, i dont feel comfortable sharing\nher name and let alone details of this, but i ran out in shorts on midnight to call police,\nthey showed up in 11 fucking minutes ( WHEN IT WAS ***EXTREMELY*** URGENT )\nbut anyway, besides that, it went horribly, turned out to be a false alarm, but a very loud\nand scary false alarm, this shit made both of us feel like total shit, it broke down\nour relationship terribly and we thought wed never talk again, at that time i just couldnt\nmyself, trauma, trauma i say, during that week a fuckton of shit more happened, overall,\nhorrible shit and it just oof, it broke down her, me and her friends ( her friends are\nan inseparable part of her so usually how she feels affects her friends in a similar way\ni feel like, at least from my perspective ), after all of it passed, we were good again,\nhoping this would never happen again and to be fair nothing like that happened again, although\nduring it ( literally a day after this all started ) something bad happened again, it didnt\ninvolve gzodis, but it involved me, camera, live, and overall just almost repeated the\nsecond day ( the event ) again by accident, you can take this paragraph as 2 breaking points,,\nbut ...\n\nthere was another breaking point, actually quite recent, me and her got into kinda a fight,\nand as this is the 3 rd time something like this happens i was scared for it to repeat again and\ni decided to just suggest ending the relationship on good terms, we did to be fair, but it was\nsad, i explained why and how and whatnot and she knew all of it, not from me, but yeah, she\nknew, n!t sure who told her, but yeah, anyway, sometimes i am scared of her and her friends\nand i do have reasons, i know and knew why and she is getting better at it, which im glad,\nim hoping after these 3 breaking points there wont b a 4 th and then a 5 th and then a 6 th\nand then ..., im scared of it repeating and i hope it doesnt,,\n\ngzodis was probably the biggest event during this shitty summer, its crazy how much happened\nin this short period of time and its just crazy, we clicked so good, we exploded apart, we\ngot back together, we exploded again and now were good again, im glad, but well see what the future\nholds for us, im hoping i can replace the void my best friend of 10 ( would b 11 soon ) left in me\n\nnow, speaking of my best friend, this summer we broke apart, i couldnt take it anymore and just idk,\nits extremely sad, i still grief about it today, it was 10 yrs, so many memories, conversations,\nwords said to one another, i remember our minecraft phase for example when we used to build\nworlds / minimaps for one another, how we used to talk in our own language in 2 nd grade in lessons,\nhow we, well used to now, exchange gifts, how we used to go on birthday things, i think its all over\nand i am very sad about it, its honestly depressing much time we spent together and all for it\nto just end, i understand that friends come and go but you know, 10 yrs, ten years is quite\nliterally 2/3 rds of my life, im hoping sometime as adults we can meet and discuss our memories\nand b friends again, hopefully less troubled and wiser with a lot to share, happier than before\n\nthis summer i also got in touch with my old friend corbin, we met through minecraft a few yrs ago\n( back in 2020-21 ? ) when i was really into minecraft stuff, he was nice, very nice, i honestly\nmiss him, but he has changed, when i got in touch with him we called and he seemed apathetic and\ncold, idk, something about him just is changed and he isnt the same anymore, he used to b sweet,\ncaring and just nice from what i remember, we used to talk so much online even 7000 km apart,\nwe used to play minecraft, talk about stuff, do random things and stay up talking, i remember once\ni fell asleep on call and corbin also fell asleep with me so i just woke up to corbin sleeping on call\nwith me and it was honestly so wholesome lol, that day nobody was home and i was tired and didnt\nknow what to do, so out of the boredom i just fell asleep as i was restless that day, today i remembered\na song he listened with me on call with me once and said 'this is the song that keeps me alive' or\nsomething along the lines of that, today i literally looked up 'cat singing boop beep song' and found it --\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1K4EAXe2oo> and i am very glad, i left an open letter to him lol :\n\n> i miss you corbin, if you ever see this and remember this song, i am ari, i remember you\n> listening to this song once, i think you were going through a touch episode that day and\n> im genuinely remembering this now, missing the day when we were on a call and overall talking to\n> u, u were a good friend, although the sad thing is that uve changed and i dont think our relationship\n> would b the same, but i do miss and appriciate every moment we had together, i know its\n> stupid for me to write an open letter to u on a song u listened to 2-3 yrs ago, but i dont care lol,\n> i just want to let my thoughts spill and maybe ull remember when we listened to this together and find\n> this, thank you corbin for all ur time, memories ( even though 7000 km apart ) and genuinely being\n> my friend, and even though our relationship wouldnt b the same anymore,\n> i will always cherish everything we did together\n\nand saw my comment 2 yrs ago ( im assuming 3 soon ) saying\n\n> \"\"\"\n> Lyrics :\n> Baby blue buildings far above the crystal grove\n> Magenta plated terrace with a table and a stove\n> Guarded golden railing just to frame the pretty stars\n> Fix that old piano and the birds will fall apart\n> \"\"\"\n>\n> W H A T\n\nhonestly pretty funny how it went from 'lmao what' to 'corbin, i miss you and all the memories we had\ntogether, i just want u to know that i appreciate you and time we spent together' or something along\nthe lines of that\n\ncorbin was 1 out of 4 really cool people ive met through minecraft, one of them reached out to me,\nfound me, sly, i remember we had a bedrock realm named [redacted] or something, i remember we had a\nwebsite for it, i still have the sources for it, i have a pic of him too, and his phone number lol,\neverything he gave me access to i still have lol, i am very unsure how he found me but i can only assume\nold comments, my website or looking my full name up lol, he emailed me asking me if i remember him\nand i literally begun shaking, my autistic ass cannot handle that much happiness at once, i gave him my\ndiscord right after he emailed me, i cant wait to talk to him, i missed him and was hoping that this day\nwould come, i remember how badly our relationship ended, cheating, ( skiddy ) hacking, destroying, anger,\netc,, it ended on quite bad terms, but i am glad he reached out a while later lol\n\nthere were 2 more people i can only hope to find in this wide world, mff ( shortened bc privacy\n) and some other guy\ni cant put my finger on really and eva, eva and me were friends from an lgbt support grp iirc\nand we bonded over minecraft ( also there was some guy named max in that group which was very cool,\nhe was a skater alien green heart type of person, also rodrigo which was like a parent figure for me\nonline, now a role my best friend holds ), all of us ( me, eva, mff and the other guy ( he associates with\ncolour yellow for me ) ) were friends until something happened and then it all went to shit, i think\nit mightve happened during when me and sly broke down ? i can only imagine what went down lol\n\nminecraft era was mainly about friends for me, but i have no clue why im talking about this in a doml,\nwell its kinda related bc well stuff happened and minecraft was the game that bonded and broke relationships\nfor me, i might b a propriatary software and micropenis hater, but i am thankful i had my minecraft phase\n\nthis summer was really friends, memories, sentimental stuff oriented,, as per me, i didnt do much,\ni thought id do way more this summer, but this summer is shitty overall\n\ni worked on a silly bot called [124](https://ari-web.xyz/gh/124)\nfor my friend group to use, pretty cool, i like it, developed a library called [rebelai](https://ari-web.xyz/gh/rebelai)\nfor it, now currently working on re-doing [pwdtools](https://ari-web.xyz/gh/pwdtools)\nfrom scratch and more modular and re-usable, i got new hardware too, which is nice, although\nits so new my for example wifi card doesnt work lol, i have to use a wifi adapter ( pls someone ( fucking mediatek )\nimplement a driver for `mediatek 7902`, i only have exp in basic drivers in linux, from stuff i see\nthe demand is growing and ye ), currently doubled the ram ( 8 gigs instead of 4 ), a much better cpu\n( amd ryzen 5 7530u ) and overall nicer hardware, im glad i have this compared to my old\nlaptop lol, this is so much nicer to work with, the ram is probably what made the biggest diff for me,\nim so glad i got a ram upgrade lol\n\nthis summer i went from vegetarian to vegan because of multiple developed allergies and intolerances,\nmy self-harm and eating disorder stuff has gotten better which is cool i guess, not a clue how or why\nbut it happened, but idk, i feel like when school starts its all going to go to shit\n\ni tried out for example weed, which was nice, actually the thing that restored hope in my life kinda,\nit was a huge wakeup call when my anxiety, depression and whatnot became so clear and me just like always\nliving with it, it was such a mind boggling exp and idk, im glad i did i guess ?\n\nmy relationship with my parents is getting better, which is also very cool, im glad ive gotten to a point\nwhere i can stay with for example my mother in the same room for a big before my anxiety takes hold of me,\nor be comfortable enough to talk abt things like makeup with her casually, or literally have an lgbt flag\non my wall displayed, overall just like being comfortable around her is something i never really saw happening,\nbut it did, its happening and i am so glad it is, theyre also respecting my privacy more and im just very\nthankful everything like this currently\n\nim turning 16 in less than a month ( sep 10 th ), turning a 10 grader even sooner ( IN 8 DAYS ), getting my\nID pic taken too ( i am restless, ill look even worse than i would have if i slept in it ), next summer im working,\nwho knows if ill even pass grade 10, 10 th exams, overall high expectations, im very scared for 10 th grade,\nand i know my grades will b shit, for example the mathematics trigonometry course is giving me shiver right now,\nim going to do so bad and im so sure about it, i hate it, even thinking abt it gives me the worst anxiety ever,\ni feel terribly overwhelmed with it and its not even started yet, idk, ill see what will happen but oh god ...\n\nim hoping to make most of this academic yr and not fail, hoping to at least get a 4 so i could pass lol, and im\nhoping to do more in terms of self\n\ni feel scared of growing up and its soon, in 2 yrs i will b considered a legal adult and i barely know\nwtf a pvm is \ud83d\udc80 im scared of the future, im anxious abt everything that could happen lol, i know literally\nnothing and idk, im just lost yk\n\nanyway, as u can tell this summer pretty boring and in terms of self i barely did anything, eventwise\nthis summer was pretty bad, but my summer did have some hidden jewels scattered around, im happy im\nhere currently, but i would not like to relive most of this summer lol, but i also dont want for\ntime to go by either so idk, i just wanna b stuck in time happily living my life as is currently\n\nthanks for listening to my rambling\n\nari\n\n2023/08/23\n",

      "content": "hi, i uh, basically i eat this thing whenever i feel like it and it always turns out nice,\nthis recipe is for 9 quite big dumplings, which is basically around 3 servings of 3 :3\nalthough this is very filling\n\n# ingredients\n\n-   filling\n    -   100 g of small spinach\n    -   2-4 pieces of garlic\n    -   1 yellow chilli pepper\n    -   half a teaspoon of turmeric\n    -   white part of a leek\n    -   1 medium carrot\n    -   100 g of firm tofu\n    -   30 ml of soya sauce\n    -   30 ml of lemon juice\n    -   20 g of sesame seeds\n    -   pinch of salt\n    -   olive oil\n-   dough\n    -   half a teaspoon of ( freshly ) ground pepper\n    -   pinch of salt\n    -   200 g of flour\n    -   water\n-   baking\n    -   olive oil\n    -   tablespoon of soya sauce\n    -   1 cup of water\n-   serving\n    -   sweet chilli sauce\n\n# making it\n\n## filling\n\n1. grease your pan with olive oil\n2. put your sesame seeds and turmeric in it\n3. chop garlic and the yellow chilli pepper, mash them together\n4. put mashed up garlic and chilli pepper into the pan\n5. chop up the white part of the leek and put it into the pan\n6. grate the carrot and also put that into the pan\n7. wash and chop your spinach, put it into the pan\n8. take your tofu and crumble it with your hands, put it into the pan\n9. pour in your lemon juice and soya sauce on top of everything\n10. add a pinch of salt\n\ncook everything til everything releases its juices and stops boiling in its own juices, doesnt\nmean the end result has to be dry, it just has to stop boiling, make sure to mix\n\n## dough\n\n1. in a bowl pour in your flour, salt and pepper\n2. mix everything uup\n3. pour water slowly while mixing until it begins forming a dough\n4. begin kneading your dough til it becomes smooth ( might need to add more water or flour in this step )\n\nthe end result should leave you with a barely sticky dough which isnt too hard to form\n\n## making dumplings\n\n1. get a plate ready and coat it in flour\n2. from the dough you have, form wrappers using your hands or tools\n3. fill it with filling and close up the wrapper\n\nrepeat this process til you run out of filling\n\n# baking it\n\n1. take your dumplings and transfer them to an olive oil greased tray\n2. cook your dumplings in a 200 celsius temp until the wrappers begin setting up\n3. pull out your dumplings and let them sit til you proceed with other steps\n4. in a cup of water pour in a tablespoon of soya sauce and mix\n5. grease a pan and put your dumplings in it, put on the lid and let them cook for around 3 minutes\n6. after that pour in like 30 ml of the soya sauce and water into the pan and close the lid right after\n7. let it steam until it stops\n8. open the lid and unstick all dumplings from the bottom of the pan ( say sauce residue will make it stick probably )\n9. let it cook for 5-7 minutes\n10. place them on a plate\n\nkeep in mind that the cooking time depends on the size of the dumplings, keep\nan eye, smaller dumplings will require less time\n\n# serving\n\ni prefer to eat it with chilli sauce so i suggest you try it :)\n\nenjoy\n\n# nutritional value\n\n-   calories per serving 421\n-   fat 8.1 g / 10%\n    -   saturated fat 1.3 g / 7%\n-   cholesterol 0 mg / 0%\n-   sodium 765 mg / 33%\n-   carbohydrate 73.3 g / 27%\n    -   dietary fibre 5.4 g / 19%\n    -   total sugars 7.3 g\n-   protein 14.7 g\n-   vitamin d 0 mcg / 0%\n-   calcium 203 mg / 16%\n-   iron 6 mg / 35%\n-   potassium 492 mg / 10%\n",

      "content": "today i was talking to people about trans stuff as i am trans myself, it all\nstarted by me talking to one of my friends about it bc she wanted to so yh, we did,\nand i thought it might be interesting to share\n\nso, the topics will include :\n\n- suicide\n- gender dysphoria\n- other social issues\n- transitioning\n- medicine\n- discrimination\n- harsh reality of being trans\n\nkeep in mind, i am no professional or anything, ill just be talking from my personal\nexp, other trans ppl i met exp and publically available statistics, and obv not talking\nfor every trans person\n\nso, i feel like its an undeniable fact that being trans isnt just roses, tulips, cakes\nwith cherries on top and strawberry scented perfume, its a constant fight for your rights,\nquestioning, discrimination, genocide and suicide\n\ntrans people are very suicidal, and do u rlly think its a coincidence,\n[the statistics speak for themselves](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32345113/)\nand its only proven by the fact that terms like\n[transgender suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_genocide)\nexist, not only that, theres many other publically available statistics that just\nprove my fucking point, no matter how much i fucking say it, like\n[worse healthcare and more addiction, mental illness, etc ( w : statistic from 2015 but i doubt much has changed )](https://www.amsa.org/action-committee/gender-and-sexuality/transgender-health/)\ni could go on and on about statistics, but these are just few things out of like a billion\nthings why being trans sucks, which also should be enough proof for transphobes that being\ntrans is in fact, not a choice\n\ncontinuing the saga, being trans alone is literally close to fucking impossible,\nbeing individualistic is hard bc of discrimination, how the world treats you and so on,\nsuicide rates are high as mentioned, meaning having someone is def needed, getting\nproper trans care is hard, waitlists are long ( 1-3 yrs from what ive searched )\neven then its not guaranteed to be good healthcare, people wait for yrs to get it\nand people die in the process due to usually, well, mentioned suicide, even if u\nmanage to wait it out, ull have to do it again, and again, and again, it never stops,\nthe system is built to kill and torment trans people\n\ni also feel like a 'diagnosis' for gender dysphoria is complete and utter bullshit, i mean\nwhy do i have to prove if im 'trans enough' to transition, do cis people have to prove theyre\n'cis enough' to get hormones, for example cis men getting TRT, they can just go to their\ngeneral practitioner and get it, but oh if a trans person needs it they have to go through\nmultiple psychologists and psychiatrists, get on multiple large wait time waitlists, try to\nget a prescription, lie, face many troubles just to do the same thing cis people can get done\nin a couple of days lol, it feels like this is just an extra step and an excuse for trans\ngenocide, this also enforces an idea of 'transgender = mental illness' bc you have to\nget a diagnosis to be 'medically' trans\n\nin the mean time we can only continue fighting, expressing ourselves, protesting,\ntalk to people, educate them, share\nour experiences, call out, poke fun and just show how ridiculous this transphobia rooted system\nis, how fucked up and deranged it is, hopefully more people understand it and accept it instead\nof being trans seen as a shameful thing people should be killed for, we, as trans people,\nhave to work as a community if we want greater good for us ( current generation of trans\npeople ) and future generations of trans people and thankfully we realised this way before\nand are working towards, so if youre trans or an ally, dont be quiet, educate, support,\ndo something about it,\ndont stick to an individualistic mindset of 'what will this do *to me, and only me specifically*',\nthink about what will it achieve for the whole community rather than you specifically\n\nand for future generations of transgender people, you are 'trans enough' even if that exists\n\nand as per my personal exp, its not good either, i mean its gotten better over the yrs and\nlithuania is moving forward, but its very far from perfect and its still a very anti-lgbt\ncountry which has a lot of room to improve, not even related to lgbt stuff, in general, lithuania\nis piss, online i still get quite a bit of transphobia and many people like to use the fact\nthat im trans to make me look bad, which is extremely stupid, but oh well, what can u\nexpect from transphobes right lmao,,\n\nanyway, the final message id like to leave before going is :  let go of your self-centered mindset\nand work towards the greater good of the entire transgender community, including yourself,\ndont remain in the shadows of ignorance, instead, raise your voice and fight for equal rights until\nwe are all treated as human beings once again\n",

      "content": "right so ... schr\u00f6dingers crush\n\nlet me explain what a schr\u00f6dingers crush even is, basically i just made this thing up, based\noff [schr\u00f6dingers cat](https://wikiless.tiekoetter.com/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger's_cat?lang=en), lets say ur in the same\nsituation as me right now, u hate to love and love to hate, ur crush is basically ( although figuratively )\ndead, which is what i will talk about today\n\ni think ( actually i probably know ) that i have a schr\u00f6dingers crush, i wont mention him by name, but lets\ncall him idk jack if itll be relevant\n\nanyway, ive been crushing on him since around 8 th grade, now im soon-to-be 10 th grader and im starting to have\nmore of a hate for him than love, ive spent quite a chunk of time on him, worrying abt him, thinking abt him,\ngenerally crushing on him, its sad but it happens, oh well, most ppl just get over it, although if u\nspend enough time on a person and like them a lot like me, u develop a **schr\u00f6dingers crush**,\nwhich is quite painful, i hate to love him is what im trying to say lol, ive had my fair share of rose\ntinted glasses by now and am seeing him now, like im not in anything serious with him but hes def more to\nme than just 'some rando idc abt'\n\nanyway, few reasons :\n\ni dont like the way hes perfect, like hes crazy perfect, all in looks, social life and skills, hes very\nattractive, as proven by literally everyone finding him attractive, hes opposite of what ud call *bitchless*,\nhis proportions are good, hands a nice, hes tall and i find his voice somewhat pleasing but sometimes i just\ncant listen to it lol hes very social, friendly and nice and hes VERY skillful, hes like cracked at everything, hes wikipidia\nsquared, he knows so much its just damn, ppl only having specific knowledge at something like me with it can beat him\nat one specific subject, hes so perfect its hard to see his flaws, which is very annoying,\ndue to this everyone likes him, treats him as flawless and like some sort of monarch i feel like lol\n\n... due to that, hes also very overpowering, lets take school as an example, right until he wasnt my classmate,\ni.e. this yr, to me he looked like the perfect, smart, cute guy, although this yr were classmates and i uh, thats\nno, bad, teachers love him and give him priority, even then, jack just talks, but if he doesnt everyone just\nexpects jack to say smt at this point, only time its rlly not that bad to talk to him is when hes not in school,\nits not as overpowering and u just get less scared and actually have a way in something rather than being\nshut down by some 124 ( \ud83e\udd13 nerding \ud83e\udd13 nerd \ud83e\udd13 idc abt ur paragraphs \ud83e\udd13 shut up \ud83e\udd13 talking to a wall )\nnerd lol, i mean i feel bad for saying this but still, its annoying as a fellow classmate of his that hes like this,\nwhat makes it worse is that hes my crush\n\nonce, around the start of the yr iirc, he also pulled a 'dont let them know ur last move' move, basically we\nhad to present our favourite person, i presented my best friend iirc or grandma idr, others presented their\nfamily and stuff, u will not guess what this smart ass of a man presented ... andrew tate, omg, andrew tate, that\nsmooth ass egg looking mf whos a proven sex trafficker, misogynist and an abuser, thats HIS FAVOURITE PERSON,\nliterally nobody expected that from him, the class went so silent when he presented him ... its just woah, anyway,\nthats my first huge red flag for him, but oh well right ? if he doesnt act on it or anything its fine ? right ????\n\ni uh, yeah, uh, he acts on it \ud83d\udc4d obv not as bad ( actually idk, idk what he does in his free time lmao )\nas andrew tate ( bc that would be illegal ), but def makes weird comments publically, for example in politics class\nwe had like a lesson abt womens rights, he literally laughed at it, and not like its the only time, he did it\nmultiple times, although i cant fully recall it, i def remember politics class, two incidents, 2 nd was abt abortion\nrights where he once again laughed at it\n\nalso one more weird thing, i cant recall if it was before the womens rights incident or after, but basically, in english\nclass, him together with his friends were making fun of me being lgbt lol, like im fairly 'lgbt looking' irl and\nclass knows i think lol, although i never said it directly, anyway, as ive mentioned it was english class at the time\nand when they made fun of me english teacher got so man, like yeah, i get it, but omg i literally almost started\nshaking, i got red and embarrassed, confused even, it was such a painful situation, like yes, im grateful for it,\nbut oh god, i even asked 'what happened huh what huh' and she just shut me lol, i feel sorry for them,, but i mean,,,,,,\ni,, i dont think i do ? do i ? i mean idk tbh, eh, so this just adds to his pile of bullshit\n\nanyway, i think this is enough to prove he isnt flawless like i thought and p much everyone to this day thinks, hes\nopposite of that and thats why i hate to like him, hes not what he presents as, hes fucking horrible, i mean,\nhes not horrible, but hes not good, omg, i feel like im giving him such a large chance to look good but hes fucking\nit over, its so annoying, its like the rose tinted glasses are superglued on me, im fucking over this so much,\ni hate it, its painfully hard to get over my feelings for him even though I WISH i could, i hate it, its bad and\new, i wish i just didnt need to see him lol, i wish i didnt feel anything for him and i was free to see him as just\n'some weird nerd rando i dislike', wish i could see him anything but perfect, thankfully my rose tinted glasses\nare falling off at a rapid rate and i hope it stays this way lol\n\nanyway, hope u never have to go though a schr\u00f6dingers crush, get out of this delusion as quick as u can, get out of\nthe rose tinted glasses stage as far as u can, i stayed in my delusion and now im here, crushes dont go anywhere\nusually anyway, so fuck it lol, drop it while u can\n",

      "content": "hi\n\nim fucking exhausted from today, i mean not that it was physical or anything, its\nliteral saturday and ive been just too depressed to get out of bed, although a thing made\nit much worse and almost pushed me into a panic attack\n\nbasically a friend of mine has been threatening to contact a person i like a lot recently,\nlike sure, thats fine, idc, but she always makes it seem so creepy, like she wants to make me\nlook like a stalker, but especially today, she wrote a love letter and threatened me to send it,\ni begged that she wouldnt and yeah, then she actually sent it and said it had my name on it\nand i believed it as the original one had my name in it and all, she already threatened me to do it,\nshe threatened other times to contact him for me ( like one time, which also sounded so creepy\nwas when she wanted to *'scare'* him into talking to me, like imagine how creepy that would be ) ...\ni went full panic mode, first depression came but then my anxiety and anger took over, i told her\nto go fuck herself ( including the rest of the people who saw this happen ) and went away to try to cope,\nmusic never helps so i scrapped that, then i went to hit my head, that just made me nauseous, then\ni looked for more coping mechanisms but i was too tense to be able to look at everything at detail,\ni was pulling my hair to release some tension, but yeah, guess what she did next, she fucking told me\nshe didnt do it and put her name instead, like omfg, did she just want to play with my feelings\nor something, play with me like a toy, im very sensitive and i told everyone that multiple times,\nshe knows how i reacted to other of her attempts, etc. i felt horrible and even more anger took me\nover but at that point ( even though it was only like 10 mins ) i was too tired to scream, then\nmore depression and remorse came over me so i apologized\n\n( for context i always magically feel like shit in history lessons ) this friday ( aka yesterday )\ni had history, like always i felt a bit poo but its fine, nothing unusual, the lesson went as usual,\nthe subject we went over went ok, next lesson ( i had 2 histories in a row ) we had to do some tasks,\nsure, i started doing them, i did almost all of them but he ( being my history teacher ) kept talking\nabout some map, like i knew what map but he gave us some task, i was confused, i asked him what the task\nit, instead of telling me like a normal person, he begun shouting, he took a classmates work and shoved\nit in my face, shouting how 'i was supposed to do this' like wtf am i supposed to get out of a\ncoloured map, then he told me, we were meat to colour parts of the map ... THAT WERE ALREADY FUCKING\nCOLOURED OMFG, after that, when i was hurrying to do it as i was embarrassed and hurt already he told\nmy friend, which was sitting next to me, to give me her work or smt, at this point i was feeling horrible,\nbut oh well, i refused and i told him to stop being like this, 'its fine, i didnt ask for it, stop, please\nstop' trying to make his ass stop bc i felt tears coming in, he did stop, good, after that i asked her\nfor her work so i could do it quicker anyway as i felt shit enough already from history and now the teacher\nwith added embarrassment, the lesson ended, i walked out of the school feeling like garbage, its fine\nthough\n\nthen, on thursday, we had religion class, the whole day they were taking stuff from a person, shes\nkinda quarter friend, but that day it pissed me off, she kept talking and talking abt it, we also\ntalked more than usual that day, etc. and it annoyed me, so basically, in religion class the friend\ndidnt have her phone, i had a chance to take the phone from the person who stole it ( bc omg i found\nit so fucking annoying ) so i took the chance, i walked up and tried to take her phone from him ( the\nperson who stole it ), i failed but oh well, went back to my seat, after that the most annoying motherfucker\nout there, i wont say his name but lets call him p ( so him, p, etc. dont mix ), p decided to make a comment\nhow i need a psychiatrist and even 'offering' to take me there, i just replied that i already have one\n( as i do ), i said 'yeah ? to g, shes a fucking bitch' i said ( assume g is my psychiatrist ),\nthen there, as a classmate who has the same name as g said 'im not ur psychiatrist' and i said something\nalong the lines of 'cool, shes kinda a bitch, yalls personality kinda resembles', like i dont like g ( the classmate )\noverall, but i can bare her, she pissed me off so i just said how it is, anyway, that was a fucking\nmistake and in conclusion to this day, i need to mind my own business and stop getting annoyed when the\nsame fucking person talks about the same thing over and over again lol, i have a bad habit of taking action\ninto my own hands if it bothers me, anyway\n\non tuesday and wednesday as far as i remember nothing much happened and same for monday as once again i just\nspent my day in bed, depressed, as i didnt have school\n\nmoving a week forward, on wednesday, omg, once again, the music teacher being an annoying bitch,\nshe has a habit of being entitled and being sure she did something when for a fact she didnt, like\none time she said she definitely told us to learn parts of mass ( as in christian mass ) as a music\ngenre, sanctus or whatnot, when she fucking didnt, she didnt, nobody knew that and the max grade was 9\nlmao ( we use 1-10 here ), now this time, once again during a test, we only had listened to 10 songs\nbut she gave us a test from 20, although this time she was a bit more sane and gave us time to listen\nto the songs we need and told us that we can write next week, but she still insisted she told us and that\nwe listened to every song, when in fact we only had listened to 10 of them, oh well, next week we wrote it\nand it went ok, i got a 9, possibly bc i mistook song #11, but i dont know, well see next week\n\nnow, some misc things that happened and i dont remember when\n\n- some day school psychologist made a microsoft teams group ( as were forced to use that piece of shit )\n  with a few mentally unstable people in school, including me, in a month were having days where we have no school\n  but we do practice work and stuff, so she suggested for us, unstable people, to join, actually i might lol,\n  all other lessons sound like shit and i dont want to work that hard during those days, psychology will be like\n  self discovery and stuff, i found that funny how in a school of like 420 or smt people i was added there,\n- i finished reading 1984, i enjoyed it, i presented it and this week i gave my work to the teacher to\n  rate and stuff, well see how it turns out, hoping its fine\n- i havent done serious code in a while so thinking about developing something, maybe a package manager ( maybe\n  even some linux distro from scratch ), maybe a programming language or smt, i kinda want to work on something\n  bc i feel like im losing motivation lol and idk\n- i have *a lot* of tests coming up, like almost 2 weeks straight of tests lol, horrible, im terrified,\n  i had such thing before already, i did horribly, i got such bad grades from all of them because i was overwhelmed\n  by so many tests, this will probably be the same, lovely\n- i dropped my daily calorie intake, wont give any numbers, but my body isnt taking it well, i mean it was\n  small before, but its even smaller, am not able to maintain it that good, like i dont go over the limit\n  but i feel worse, like today i stood up and just fell to the ground like a bag of bones\n- overall, im losing my life more and more, i quit therapy and stuff ( ive talked about it before ),\n  so im just there losing my last hope lol, oh well, too bad\n\nanyway, hope this wasnt too painful to read, for fun me and my friends read some fanfics and omg theyre\nso badly written i cant, hope u dont have the same exp here, til next time\n",

      "content": "## warning : this post includes spoilers !!\n### ( if u want my work, im happy to share it, although its in lithuanian, email me : [ari.web.xyz@gmail.com](mailto:ari.web.xyz@gmail.com)  )\n\ni just finished reading 1984 as i needed to pick a book to read for school\nand i already wanted to read it so yeah, i found a lithuanian translation and\nit was honestly extremely good\n\nbasically of a summery of my work\n\n> Throughout their diary entries, the reader provides a comprehensive and engaging account\n> of their journey through \"1984\" by George Orwell. The reader discusses each chapter\n> or section of the book that they have read, summarizing the events and themes\n> covered and providing their own thoughts and insights.\n>\n> The reader notes the pervasive and extreme methods of control used by the Party,\n> including censorship, propaganda, and surveillance, which are designed to maintain complete\n> obedience and conformity among the population. The reader also describes how Winston's character\n> is subjected to torture, brainwashing, and degradation, leading to his ultimate subjugation and submission to the Party.\n>\n> The reader expresses their admiration for the book's writing style, which\n> they describe as engaging, well-crafted, and emotionally resonant. The reader notes\n> that some parts of the story are difficult to read due to their disturbing and emotionally\n> intense nature, but also acknowledges the book's ability to\n> provoke strong emotional reactions and convey important messages about power, control, and individual freedom.\n>\n> In addition, the reader provides an in-depth analysis of various themes and motifs in the book, such as the nature of truth,\n> the power of language and thought, and the dangers of authoritarianism. The reader also reflects on their\n> own experiences and emotions while reading the book, offering a personal and vulnerable perspective on the story.\n>\n> In the end, the reader gives the book a rating of 11/10 and highly recommends it to others. The reader's diary entries are a\n> thoughtful, nuanced, and comprehensive analysis of \"1984\" and its themes, while also conveying the emotional\n> impact of the story on the reader.\n\nbasically, i found book very interesting, the beginning and middle were very fun to read, but\nthe end was scary, basically, even though i didnt have much to say, i liked it, it showed how winston\nchanges over time and stuff, how winston gets so brainwashed into submission by the party into loving\nbig brother, how he falls into submission that 2 + 2 can be anything, how he and jualia betrayed\none another and what at first seemed fluffy love with a cliche storyline, it ended in a heartbreaking\nstop to their relationship and then the death of winston with his brainwashed and crushed personality\nafter a lot of torture and jailing\n\nits a very engaging story with an interesting storyline, ive only read one good ( but not as good )\nbook, white shroud ( baltoji drobul\u0117 ) by antanas \u0161k\u0117ma, both had a very nice story line and i really\nenjoyed reading them, both of them showed strong emotion which i really liked, characters faced trouble\nin life but somehow managed and overall they were good books\n\nwhile reading 1984 i made this blog post -- <https://blog.ari-web.xyz/b/corporate-marionettes/> and\n1984 was an inspiration for me even though i already used that term before ive read it, thats why\n1984 still stands to this day, in the age where companies get a monopoly on peoples data and algorithms\nso good to keep u on there its like the party shoving u into its ideologistic system, which many people\nare brainwashed, like winston at the end, to not resist and follow their trails without saying a word\n\none of the most striking parts for me is how much impact totalitarianism makes to a human mind, winston\nwas healthy and was correct, party should be overthrown and is not stable, it is an oppressive mess\nbuilt on hate and discrimination, but then they turned him into a weak bag of bones which was easily\nforced into submission and their ideology, they turned him into a toy without any will or identity\n\nto conclude, i think anyone interested in power, control, truth and individual freedom should read it, its\na lovely and interesting book and i think a lot of people would enjoy it\n\nhave a nice day, hopefully i peaked your interest a bit :)\n",

      "description": "basically a dupe of 'transgender' post without me even knowing lol",
      "content": "omfg at this point i have to say something, its pissing me off how much transphobia is affecting me and\nother trans people recently, as a trans person, MTF, i get quite a lot of hate just from being trans,\nwhether its online in trolling, bullying form or irl bullying, other forms discrimination and so on, i\nfucking hate how the world is currently, so let me talk about it\n\nfirst up, let me define what transphobia is, transphobia is defined as follows :\n\n> Transphobia is a type of discrimination or prejudice against transgender\n> or gender non-conforming individuals. It can take many forms, including verbal\n> or physical abuse, exclusion from social or professional opportunities, or denial\n> of basic human rights. Transphobia is based on a lack of understanding or acceptance\n> of gender identity that does not conform to traditional binary notions\n> of male and female. It can have serious negative effects on the mental health and\n> well-being of trans individuals, leading to depression, anxiety, and even suicide.\n\nbut i call it 'the feeling that makes me feel shit at every moment of my life and any\ncomments can set it off, although im too much of a pussy to say anything about it bc i am a useless\nanti-social idiot on top of that i get treated like dog shit except that at least gets picked up :)'\n\nthe current state of trans people as a group is bad, everything is going to shit and it seems like\neveryone is going after us for everything, ive met so many transphobes in the recent times and tbh\nim scared to say anything about it, like i want to, but i cant, my brain isnt letting me, im\nscared and i cant do anything about it, like tranphobes made me think that standing by my own points\nis bad and should not be done but instead you should suffer in silence and say nothing abt it,\nwhich is total fucking bullshit, i am so fucking done with all of this i cant, i want to be able to,\nbut its just fucking impossible, my brain has that engraved and i hate it, i feel like a trapped rat\nin their prison of bigotism and discrimination, at this point if a person finds out im trans and they\ncomment about it i feel the need to be sorry about my identity and say 'im sorry that im trans, you\nprobably think im gross and shit, sorry' or something along the lines of that, it feels like\nwe, as a group of people are being forced into some sort of modern hitler-esc ideology where the world\nis monogamous and anything else than that should be made extinct\n\nnone of this is pretty or good, i might say its 'fine' when youre being directly transphobic to my face\nbut its really not and behind your back im not happy with any of what uve said or done, i use laughing\n( even online ) to deflect tension, i hate it, why do yall feel like we have to fit into your fucking\nclosed off box of little one-braincell ideology, fuck this shit and fuck you for doing all the shit you\ndo to make our lives as painful as you can, your complaining about how its 'unnatural, gross, ungodly,\nbad, cringe, stupid, confusing' and etc. is so fucking annoying, we already are a very small group with\nvery little rights and on top of that yall overpower us with like 2387678296789326% of the population going\nafter us, like come fucking on, get a life and stop being a plain fucking asshole, im so sorry for using\nsuch stupid language but i am so fucking mad at so many people and theres nothing i can really do than\ncomplain about how shitty their behaviour is\n\none of the [situations](https://user.ari-web.xyz/#89) that triggered me to write this is mrbeast situation about the 'karl effect' or\nsome shit, god i see transphobes cling onto that so much on the internet now, its painful to even watch,\nits gross, this is nothing than pure homophobia and transphobia\n\nanother situation is me actually facing anti-lgbt stuff both irl and online today, wont get into\ndetail bc i dont want to\n\nand what do u know, [texas loves this shit too](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/apr/25/texas-agriculture-department-dress-memo-sid-miller)\n'consistent to their biological gender' my ass, my brain hurts from the stupidity of transphobes,\ntheir hitler-like ideology, stupid fucking idiocy which keeps bothering me\n\nthis isnt just a US issue either, this is very relevant is every country and continent, for example, even in\neurope, which id consider fairly developed, this is a large issue, we still face issues with healthcare ( actually\nA LOT of issues ), employment, education, and housing, this is especially visible in like poland and hungary where\nits like built in lmao, lets not forget to mention my homeland of lithuania, being any type of lgbt anywhere\noutside capital city of vilnius is terrible, i face a lot of anti-lgbt comments, bullying ( to the point of physical\nharassment ) and so on, everywhere and anywhere i go, i even get spit on sometimes just bc i dont present\n\u2728 typically male \u2728, omfg, i hate this, but america, africa, australia, asia and so on also have the same issues,\nin america its right-wing individuals who are trying to shunt down transgender people all bc it doesnt fit into\ntheir conservative view of the world ( and so, they should be made extinct ), africa due to religious and cultural\nviews on gender and sexuality, australia is progressing but trans people still have quite a lot to deal with both\nsocially and access to services like healthcare and asia, once again about religious and cultural views\n\nnot that i find this funny, but its funny how close minded people are everywhere around the world, i mean yes, there\nare people who are truely open minded, but theres so many people calling themselves tolerant 'as long as i dont see them'\nor 'as long as its not my kids' or some shit, or freak out whenever a trans person comes out and they go attack\nthem just bc, actually in my psychology class we had a similar test, basically like 99% of the class called themselves\ntolerant, including myself, then we were questioned and questioned 'would you accept this person if they were a part of\n[some minority]' and other questions, they were related to race, culture, religion, sexuality, gender, etc. and guess\nhow many hands were left at the end out of 29 ... 2, fucking two, me and another classmate, omfg, i find this so fucking\ncringe and just terrible, how can you call yourself tolerant if you do this shit, my god\n\ni also find some of the reasons funny, like 'its religion' or some shit, like alright, believe in what you want, but\nhow does that give you the right to discriminate against and stuff other people ? how does that change the\nfact that youre transphobic and want people dead ? how does that change anything that youre doing, its still horrible\nand not acceptable, this applies to anything, ive heard people use the same excuse over and over and over again\nfor all sorts of topics, including racism, homophobia, transphobia, abilism and fatphobia, which none of those\nare okay\n\nanyway, concluding, transphobes fucking suck and everything about them is cringe, bad and theyre little pricks with no\nlife, i hate how many people like that exist in all shapes and sizes, in all countries, all identities, cultures, races,\ncontinents, unions and so on, but i guess ill keep pretending 'its fine, you can be transphobic, yeah i totally\ndont care, im sorry for being so gross and bad in your eyes, ill try my best to not be trans :))'\n\ntake care .\n",

      "content": "i unironically use 'corporate marionette' to describe people who are sheep\nto companies, usually in context of digital privacy, which is becoming a more and more\nconcerning issue and worst part, nor people in power nor general public isnt doing anything\nabt it, its genuinely sad to see how brainwashed people are and how much they dont give\na fuck about it, not understanding ( actually not even wanting to understand ) how big\nof an issue this is and how theyre basically marionettes for companies\n\nin this post 'corporate marionette' will be referring to the more specific digital\ncorporate marionette and not general corporate marionette, although there might be\nmentions of both types, the primary audience of this post are people who're ( if i say\nwhore, i dont mean whore, i mean who're ) interested in digital corporate marionettes\nand people who are willing to learn more about it and are stuck in the corporate marionette\necosystem :)\n\nbefore reading this, please keep in mind that i talk a lot about proprietary stuff, as that tends\nto be more evil than open source, but keep in mind open source companies can still be creepy and weird\n\nlets start off with the issue itself -- at a high level this is purely a digital privacy issue,\nbut under it, we have more issues, including addiction, bad education, other mental health problems\nand ignorance, sometimes even if youre aware its hard to make the switch without dropping\nhalf your life down the drain, todays society is focused on being a corporate marionette, once\nagain due to the same issues\n\nwe already broke the problem down, so lets address some of the issues one by one,\n\nfirst -- **addiction**, many people, probably including me ( although im unsure ), are addicted\nto technology, they get hooked on the dopamine rush they get from various medias online,\nlets say youtube has videos and shorts, instagram posts and reels ( although ive never heard anyone\nuse them srsly ), tiktok is purely an addiction machine, twitter has a very good algorithm\nthat runs on rage ( yk the feeling when someone says something obv wrong and you correct it\nand yall keep talking abt it and none of you wants to give up ? )\nand so on, every big service runs on addiction and data collection, all are algorithm-ised,\npeople keep going down the addiction hole and companies keep mass mining their data and its just\nan infinite cycle of addiction and violating your freedom, privacy and so on until youre so deep down\nthe addiction hole you have no escape\n\n**bad education** about digital privacy and general IT is also a huge problem, digital privacy is\nbecoming more and more relevant as the new world is becoming more and more digital, companies\nget access to so much of our lives now its crazy, it sometimes feels like you can survive purely\nin that world and be just fine, almost every service has gone digital, from registering medical\napts to shopping, from entertainment to communication and so on, people arent aware of how much\ndata companies get and how much can be extracted from it and so on, people are so ignorant to the\nfact that data = power, also, IT education is also horrible, here in lithuania at least, its terrible,\nall we do is make word documents basically, in older classes we do get some more serious education,\nalthough its nothing serious, its mainly focused on specific proprietary software and how to use it,\nwhich\n\n- isnt applicable anywhere outside that specific software as its\n  usually 'so u press this, then that, then press this, drag that\n  and this is how u import a picture in word'\n- doesnt teach people anything\n- does not teach anything outside IT that isnt 'computer = word = windows = chrome = OS = number'\n\nits stupid how bad IT education is where everything is so digital\n\n**mental health problems** is also related to **ignorance**, some people are just so broken\nmentally they cant be bothered to give a fuck about anything, and not like social media with\nplastering of numbers, insecurities, triggers and addiction ( this is the PERFECT formula for\na social media site, make it cause mental health problems which eventually will lead to depression\nor something similar and then be the seemingly only remedy that will help it )\nwill make it better, so companies profit of that people ( not specific mentally ill people )\nlive in ignorance and they keep feeding into it\n\nand then theres **dependence**, even if people are fully aware people face issue of de-transitioning\nfrom that specific software or ecosystem, e.g. apple feeds of this with their hardware and software\nbeing so incompatible with everything, being so good at integrating their software and hardware\nand giving people such status ( tbh it feels like the apple ecosystem is just a huge cult ), or for\nexample friends and general social communication, i have this issue with discord, ive suggested multiple\nopen source alternatives to friends and even offered to build one myself, they refuse to switch no\nmatter what so im stuck using discord as i know how problematic discord is and how shit it is, how much\nof a data farm it is, how much it shoves nitro peoples asses, how much of a pedophilia problem it has\nand so on, i hate it, im also somewhat stuck on youtube, i had a project in the works which woulve\nbeen a good alternative to youtube, ive had it planned and stuff, but then just stopped working on it,\nalthough now its a mess and ive worked on it somewhat, a lot of UI and stuff, which i find distracting,\ni might rework it though, the problem im having is that it has so much content i watch and music and so on,\nits a nice service, although it works on my very hardened profile unlike discord so i can at least\nmitigate it more, with discord there isnt as much briar between it and me\n\nthe cycle of it continues, we need to unite if we want to have a free ( as in freedom ) world,\nelse we wont get out of this creepy data-driven idiocy, make it paid or something, but omg, i want\nmy data, you can have my money, but my data is very important to me and i dont trust this fucked up\nsystem\n\nanyway, hope i at least explained some of this enough for you to get worried enough and join me\nin the act of stopping companies abusing users data and actual digital freedom instead of false\nand misleading marketing which turns people into sheep to fall into their sheep farm\n\ncya\n",

today, shit ( but short ) lessons\nand just bad, then the first 2 classes were lithuanian, made my lithuanian\nteacher hate me, she even basically said for me to shut up, but yk, in a corporate\ntype of way, like 'stfu nobody cares' => 'please dont say anything else', i had to\npresent a thing with my group and i was stuttering, i was very stressed, i\ncant speak without stuttering when im stressed, i have to either talk really fast\nor i stutter, in this case both happened, my lithuanian teacher got pissed at me\nand now she probably hates me, then i had to rate my own work, i did my work, i\nworked with my group, i helped to manage the group and shit so i rated myself 4/10\nfor at least doing the work, then i realised my friend didnt like my opinion\nabout the thing i was presenting and probably another reason why the lithuanian\nteacher told me to stop talking mid way through my reading, so i corrected my grade\nfrom 4/10 to a 3/10, i could lie and give myself a 10/10 like most others, but i really\ndont want to get into trouble and just get an even worse grade than 3/10 lol, this is\nmy reasoning why i gave myself a 3/10 to my teacher ( translated from lithuanian to english ) :\n\n> 4/10, i was working but when i presented, i got very stressed and nervous about\n> it, i don't think i should get a 2 because i helped the team, worked,\n> did my part of the job

and it was\n> clear that the teacher didn't like my part,\n> so considering everything, i think i should get at least a passing grade -- 4.\n\n> 3/10 that + my opinion was bad\n\nmy opinion about the book i was presenting was this ( once again translated ) :\n\n> i did not like the book \"benedikto slenk\u0161\u010diai\" .\n> this book seemed superficial and boring to me .\n> the first chapter was not bad, as it talked about benedicts childhood,\n> but the other slenk\u0161\u010diai, when he grew up,\n> were tedious and i barely wanted to read them .\n>\n> in my opinion, the author described benedicts life in too much detail,\n> which could have been conveyed in a shorter way .\n> also, there are not enough interesting details in the book\n> that could inspire the reader to read further .\n> the last chapters ( slenk\u0161\u010diai ) were sad and poor, with a lot written about sex and love,\n> as if we hadnt read about it in recent years .\n> in my opinion, the author also described these\n> topics in too much detail, which could have been conveyed\n> in a shorter way, but with more interest .\n>\n> my final rating for this book would be 4/10,\n> because although the book is not the worst,\n> it does not have enough interesting details to captivate the reader .\n\nsame thing happened in art, except this time i had points to work with, still got a 3/10, but\neh, basically i had my work ( mosaic ) finished and the art teacher told me to rate myself, the\npoints ( every point has 2 points max ) were given to me and all i had to do was\nto rate myself, here are the points, scores and reasons i gave :\n\n-   methodical work in the lesson, preparation for the lesson\n    ( 1 point, i did work in the lesson but i kept forgetting my glue at home\n    so i borrowed my friends )\n-   originality, interpretation, search for ideas\n    ( 0 points, its literally just a paper with pieces of paper glued on representing\n    a stupid and badly made flower )\n-   artistry ( 0 points, its not artistic nor is it anything pretty )\n-   disclosure of topics ( 1 point, the theme was flower and its obviously a flower, but its badly made )\n-   technique ( 1 point, i mean i did glue pieces of paper on a sheet of paper )\n\nso yeah, conclusion to this is that i suck at school, i am a literal fucking failure,\ndidnt even manage to get a 4/10\n\nsince DOML #3 some shit happened too, for example i quit my IT club ( due to depression ),\ni quit therapy ( do i even deserve it lmfao ) and so on, fell back in and out of my depressive episode,\nbegun noticing how much hairloss im having, probably due to anorexia and shit,\ni keep having panic and anxiety attacks, nothing is good,\neverything in my life is going to shit and i cant to anything about it, but at least one funny\nthing happened which is how my physics teacher gave my notebook to the school psychologist\nwithout telling me ALL BECAUSE I WRITE IN SMALL LETTERS ONFG WHAT THE FUCK LMAO\n\ni think my friends also begun hating me, idk, they seem different to me, it feels like\nthey hate me for no reason and it seems to clear to me that they just dont like me\nanymore, i think i should stop talking to them but even then wouldnt that be rude\n\neverything makes me sad and / or feels like theyre hating me, its just\nshit\n\nin conclusion i suck, im stupid, everyone and -thing seemingly hates me\nand everything in my life is going to shit and i cannot do anything about it lmao\n\ngoodbye lol, cya next time ig\n",

      "content": "hello dear parents\n\ndo you suffer from doornotcloseitis ? well, there is no treatment for such an evil\ncondition, but, being the royal woman i am, im here to help, so please take some time\nout of your day and read this, this should help with your doornotcloseitis, this medical\ncourse was verified by the dda ( door and drugs association )\n\n## what is a door ?\n\na door is an important part of a building, it is a barrier that provides privacy, security,\nand protection from the elements, doors are typically made of wood, metal, or other materials,\nand can be opened and closed in various ways\n\ndoors are used to separate interior and exterior spaces,\nthey can be used to control the flow of people and goods, as well as to provide a sense of safety and security,\ndoors can also be used to provide ventilation, light, and sound insulation\n\ndoors come in a variety of shapes and sizes, and can be designed to match the style of\na building or the specific needs of the user, they can be single or double-hinged, sliding,\nor folding, and can be fitted with locks, handles, and other hardware, many doors are also equipped\nwith sensors, alarms, and other security features.\n\ndoors play a vital role in the safety and security of a building,\nthey can be used to restrict access to certain areas, and can help to protect people and property from intruders,\nthey also provide a sense of privacy and security, making people feel more comfortable\nin their homes and workplaces\n\ndoors are an essential part of any building, they provide security, privacy, and ventilation,\nand can be designed to match the style of a building or the specific needs of the user\n\n## what is a door handle\n\na door handle is a device used to open and close a door, it is usually made of metal or plastic\nand is attached to the door with screws or bolts, most door handles come in two parts :\n\n-   the latch, which is the part that is pulled to open the door\n-   and the knob, which is the part that is turned to open and close the door\n\nthe latch is usually made of metal and is usually spring-loaded, so that when the knob is turned,\nthe latch slides back into place, the knob is usually made of plastic and is designed\nto be comfortable to grip\n\ndoor handles come in a variety of styles and finishes, some door handles are designed to match the decor of a room,\nwhile others are more utilitarian in design, there are also door handles that are designed to be decorative,\nsuch as those made of brass or bronze, many door handles also come with a keyhole,\nwhich allows a key to be inserted to open the door\n\ndoor handles provide a convenient way to open and close a door without having to use a key,\nthey are also a great way to add a touch of style to a room, door handles are an important part of any home\nand should be chosen carefully to ensure they are both functional and aesthetically pleasing\n\n## how do i close a door ?\n\nclosing a door is a simple task, but there are a few key steps to ensure that it is done properly\n\nfirst, stand close to the door and grab the handle, pull the door towards you firmly and make sure\nit is in the closed position, if the door has a lock, turn the knob or key to secure it, next,\ncheck that the door is completely shut, if it is not, push the door gently until it is fully closed\n\nfinally, if the door has a latch or lock, double-check that it is secure\n\nto ensure the door is closed properly, it is important to be aware of the environment around it,\nmake sure that there is nothing in the way of the door that could prevent it from closing,\nif there is, move it out of the way, additionally, check the hinges and frame to make sure\nthey are in good condition and that the door is not sticking or binding\n\nclosing a door is a simple task, but it is important to make sure that it is done properly,\nfollow the steps above to ensure that the door is closed securely and that it is not blocked by any objects,\nadditionally, inspect the hinges and frame to make sure they are in good condition,\ndoing all of these steps will help ensure that the door is closed properly and securely\n\n## conclusion\n\nhope this helped, if youre a parent i now sincerely hope you understand what a door is now and\nhope that your doornotcloseitis will be better from now on, i hope this helped and youll be\nthrilled to use your newfound knowledge from now on\n\nhave a nice one\n",

      "content": "hello world\n\nBASH only has one okay syntax highligher, but its super slow, it implements\nthe whole readline lib in BASH, so i decided to make my own ... but its harder\nthan i thought\n\nat first, i kept running into issues with file descriptors, bash kept being annoying,\nkept blocking my stuff, but then i came up with an idea to read from its stdin and\nthen write to stderr and use ansi escapes to move the cursor and text around, it worked\nkinda ig, but theres a problem, as bash owns the fd it can steal a read() from us and\nmake us not be able to read from stdin anymore, which is painful, the concept program\nkeeps missing bytes, especially if youre typing fast, when youre typing slow its\nmuch less noticable\n\ntheres also an ansi escape issue with the cursor, it keeps going to its old position,\nbut thats probably because it keeps missing bytes, `\\r` and/or `\\n` to be specific,\nin my case `\\r` idk why bash reads `\\r` instead of `\\n`, but oh well\n\nanyway, heres the concept :\n\n- <https://gist.github.com/TruncatedDinosour/e2034cf470f268596235a5c88ffcd048>\n- <https://gist.githubusercontent.com/TruncatedDinosour/e2034cf470f268596235a5c88ffcd048/raw/fc84ff1c9f6b6b010b16eea462aeed88b6d2b274/bash_syntax_highlighting.py>\n\nhow it works is :\n\n- takes from you the target bash shell pid which you can get by running `echo $$` in the target\n- opens stdin ( `0` ) and stderr ( `2` ) file descriptors\n- opens `/tmp/{target bash pid}.bash` as an out file ( as you cant write to bash stdin for it to exec code )\n- overwrites the outfile\n- loops until stdin is okay to use / open\n    - writes ansi escape for 'save cursor position'\n    - while a single read byte from stdin is not `\\r` and / or `\\n`\n        - interprets backspaces\n        - writes 'restore cursor position' and 'clear line from cursor position' ansi codes plus the highligted\n          line to stderr\n    - write a newline to stderr\n    - if s is not empty\n        - writes the read command to the outfile\n    - sends a `SIGINT` ( basically `CTRL` + `C` ) signal to bash ( to activate PROMPT_COMMAND and get a new prompt\n      as once again -- bash doesnt like when you use its file descriptors for that )\n- at the end of the main loop it closes opened stdin, stderr and out files\n\non the target side you only need to run this\n\n    export PROMPT_COMMAND=\"source /tmp/$$.bash\"\n\nso it runs the command every new prompt as bash should not be able to read the\ncommand and we should own it\n\nso far i tried these methods to mitigate the problems i faced :\n\n- using `LD_PRELOAD` to overwrite the `read()` syscall\n    - making always return `0`\n    - redirecting it to a FIFO\n    - closing it\n- using `os.write` / `read`\n- using C++\n- using C\n\nany help to resolve the issues is welcome, although its optional, itd just help improve the\nquality of the concept and make it maybe even useful to people, you can comment [here](/c) or\nunder the gist ( preferably under the gist ), lets discuss your ideas :) you are also free\nto email me at `ari.web.xyz@gmail.com`\n\nanyway, enough talking, i think this will be a multipart series until i make something working\nor give up, once i get something working ill try to make it easy for others and develop a framework\naround it, maybe others might too, if you have any ideas how to fix it let me know and well,\nsee you next time :)\n",

      "content": "hello world\n\nhavent updated this blog in a while so i thought i might as well now,\na lot of things happened since my last visit here\n\nfirst up, today was once again a bad day, like on monday, on monday i kept losing stuff,\nkept having bad luck, bad grades, etc. -- today was the same, i kept losing stuff, my pen\nexploded and worst of all -- i only finished half my math test, dont get me wrong, the test\nwas easy, i was doing okay, but each question was like 7 parts and there were 5 questions\nso i wasnt able to finish it in 30 minutes, i only managed to do 2.5 / 5 tasks, that\nmade me feel horrible and i couldnt stop thinking abt it, i almost had to leave school\nbc i was very shit mentally, it affected me so much for some reason, but oh well,\nig if i get a low grade ill just rewrite it in consultations :/, today i also found more\nbad traits abt my crush, i alrd knew hes an andrew tate stan bc he made a whole ass talk\nabt him in english class, the theme was 'my favourite person', but today in patriotism\nclass we were talking about women's rights and my crush was just making fun of it the\nwhole time, its just sad and cringeworthy, why did i fall for a guy that ( a ) doesnt\nlike me and ( b ) is a dickhead, i also ate too many calories today, wont give any numbers,\nbut it was quite a bit for me and that also added on top of everything today, its just\nugh ...\n\nmy pc fan broke, well, now its fixed, but thats one of the main\nreasons i havent been able to write here, i didnt have my pc, i could have\nwritten on my phone but it isnt the same plus my pdb database ( basically\njust a custom password database format ) was on my pc while it was being\nrepaired, i could have fixed it myself, but i didnt have the needed part, it cost\n52 euro and itd only come on 03/06, so i just took it to the repair shop, it\ngot done faster and it cost less -- 50 euro, as a bonus my broken keys got fixed\nso im happy, now i got a fully functional pc for cheaper than if i fixed it myself,\nplus i didnt risk anything lol soooooooooo\n\na couple of days ago, on monday, i asked myself why i hate pe so much, and i\nwrote a bit abt it sooo lemme tell you, i was stressed about pe as i have pe on mondays,\ni kept thinking and just was stressed beyond belief, i wrote about how this\nhappens every day i have pe, how im stressed and how it makes me feel bad mentally,\nthe first point i wrote about -- gendered groups, ig its more of a 'gendered education'\nthing, but at least here in lithuania its barely here besides, well, pe and arts and crafts\n( idk we call it technologies, but dont mix it up with informatics ), in arts and\ncrafts we can pick the gender group no matter the gender so its eh, i wrote about how\nit causes me gender dysphoria, thats one of the largest reasons it causes me stress,\nthen i wrote that it feels bad dressing out of uniform in school, 'its probably just my\nautism' i wrote, but eh, idk, its just that it feels bad being in a school environment\nbut dressed up this casually, it feels bad and it just idk, weird, but not like id\nlike to stay in my uniform doing pe anyway, itd stink, sweat and itd be uncomfy, so lol,\nalso i wrote that pe clothing is just too lose for me as im used to tight black clothing\nas thats my main 'style' if you can call it that, im also scared of pe assignments,\nim very weak physically and im terrified of a bad grade in pe, it makes me overthink\nif im good enough, strong enough for pe and makes me stressed, im scared of judgement,\nit feels like the teacher, the children and everyone in general is watching me and waiting\nfor me to fail so they could make fun of me, might be irrational, but idk, im not the only\none who feels this way, i know bc i asked, i also dont dress up in school, i come in with\npe clothing, but uniform on top ( its only a jumper ), when pe comes i just take off my\nschool uniform and thats it, i get underessed at home during the lunch break which for me\nis 40 minutes, after pe i feel gross and tired and it takes me around 2-3 classes before\ni fully recover, until then i am unable to work at my full capacity in turn making me inefficient\nand stupid, thus risking a bad grade once again, theres 0 positive things i can say abt pe,\nmy teacher is also most likely a pedophile, he stares at girls asses whenever he can get the chance,\nas im in the girls group, i joke abt him staring at my bony ass but its just sad how such\npeople have a job with kids, he also at test times forces me into the boys grp, so he expects\nto to perform as good as a buff ass kid who is having the time of his life, like who would win,\na depressed anorexic with crippling anxiety or a buff ass dude, its annoying, i cant take\nsuch load\n\nbut good news ...\n\ni dont have to do pe anymore, my doctor wrote me a paper that states that i cant do pe anymore\nand im super happy abt it, no more stress that kills me every monday and wednesday, its nice,\ni got that paper bc of my weight and other health problems\n\nthis whole week for me was mainly a depression hole, i mean still havent gotten out of it,\nbut idk, even my room reflects it lol\n\nprevious week i also got 2 diplomas or whatever, both for the IT contest i went to, i took\nthe 1 st places in both my school and my city, although not my country, but eh, oh well ig,\nits rare that anyone takes the 1 st place in the country part lol\n\nwell, i cant think of what much to say anymore, comment if you want, im happy to hear yalls\nopinions and stuff ig, well, cya next time which will probably be soon, cya :)\n",

      "content": "remember [this post ?](https://blog.ari-web.xyz/b/i-came-out-to-my-psychologist/)\n\nso yeah, last week i couldnt meet up with my psychologist ( because stuff happened at home ), so i did this week, not too long ago i walked out of her office and even though\ni walked out sweating like a stressed pig, i feel ... good ? i mean it all went well, she was accepting,\nunderstanding, nice about it, but it was scary talking about me being trans in person, i have\nnever had to talk about it so much irl, new thing, a lot of anxiety and just aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\n\nshe said its fine and okay, she understands, she has trans clients in the past, she even asked for the name\ni go by, ~~although i couldnt say it because i was scared, ill tell her next week~~,\nshe used feminine pronouns on me this session and so on\n\nit was a lot to talk about, it was scary, i was in such a high state of stress, sweated, got shaky,\nfidgeted and stuff but now that im home, i think it was a good experience, im happy about it,\nim glad i finally opened up about my identity and that my psychologist accepted me for who i am,\nits a huge relief and im glad i was able to sorta do it\n\nshe also asked how does it feel to be trans and i couldnt really explain it, its \u2728 a feeling \u2728\nlike she asked me something along the lines of\n\n> are you a boy who just likes boys or are you a girl ? how does it feel to be trans ?\n\ni said that i am a girl and that its weird to explain how it is to be trans, i said like\n\n> it just feels that im not me, its weird to explain it\n\nor smt, i think a better explanation would be like\n\n> im a girl, it feels like like me fighting my own self, like i want to be accepted\n> but im also scared, i feel like im not a boy, i hate taking on masculine roles, i am not masculine\n> myself, i feel like nobody who is cis will understand what its like to be a trans person and the\n> struggles that come with it as its not a choice, for example, i feel like i should be in\n> the girls group if the teachers tell us to split into groups by gender\n> ( even though i think its quite bs but eh ) but i have to go the boys group\n> apparently ( like i have to fight myself ), i feel like im walking on eggshells to conceal\n> my identity and who i am trying to make sure im not offending anyone and not exposing myself\n> to just get bullied into even a deeper depression than i already am in\n\ni think this would have fit more, but i mean i have an alibi -- i was stressed beyond hell, i was sweating,\nmy heart and mind were racing, everything was just a whole ball of stress, i was sitting there in\na chair frozen, barely able to talk, although as we talked more about it i got more comfortable\n\ni think and hope next week i will be able to talk to her more about this topic and this conversation\nmade me realise, maybe i dont want to end my life yet afterall, maybe i just needed help, someone to talk\nto, after i had the convo i feel much better, its nice, although when my depression and gender dysphoria\nwill come back after such a high point for me in happiness, i will feel terrible\n\nbut oh well, at least the psychologist accepts me :)\n",

      "content": "as of now its 03:23 am in lithuania, i am writing this to just write something\ni dont feel like just staying in pure quiet, listening to the rain, feeling the\ncold, hearing my homeserver do stuff, decided to start this thing called `DOML`,\njust me writing about days of my life, what i am thinking and so on, normal\ncontent like tutorials, emotional stuff, sharing of open source news, opinions and\nso on wont go anywhere, but i want to have some sort of series on here, so why\nnot this, this will be a good practice for me to write text, get creative maybe,\nlearn more visual writing, expression and so on, should be nice\n\nright now im quite tired, but not really, its a weird feeling,\ni mean i would gladly go to bed, but i dont see the need for it really\nand i just dont want to sleep, idk, i got stuff to do for tomorrow, for example\nprepare for school, take a bath, clean and reorder my room, do my homework,\nread a shit ass book for school which i only read 49 pages of, im probably\nnot going to finish it in time but eh, who cares\n\nmy timetable for school changed, its shit, on monday i have pe as my first\nlesson, and i already ***REALLY*** hate pe, i mean i never liked this much physical\nwork, but then theres few things about pe that just make me die inside, from\nworst to 'eh idrc kinda idk' :\n\n- gender dysphoria\n    - the teacher makes us go into 'boys' and 'girls' groups and i am not\n      fully transitioned, although usually im in the girls group, but when\n      it comes to grading i get treated as a 'boy' ... i get the same tasks\n      as the buff kid in my class, i am a 38 kg stick, hes a muscly giant\n      who has been training non-stop for like 3 years \ud83d\udc80\n- anxiety\n    - every day, class, hour, minute, second, etc. before pe i get the worst anxiety,\n      during pe it usually worsens, but if i talk to my closer classmates, like\n      i dont like considering people friends really, but theyre just 'people i know'\n      usually, it gets better, but even after pe i still have \u2728 that feeling \u2728\n- pe makes me feel gross\n    - i dont dress up for pe in school as per the reason listed in the 1 st place,\n      i come to school with my pe clothing already on, on top of that my\n      uniform, which is just a jumper so i dont mind, but after pe i feel gross\n      and hot, so i just have to wait for like 2-3 ( or now, purely 3 ) classes\n      so i could go home, get my grossyness sorted out and dress up normally\n      in my lunch break ( which is 40 minutes, i usually come back at around the\n      30 mins mark )\n- hypocrisy of the teacher\n    - the teacher makes us do weird sports things and i never see him do any\n      of it, we always do it while he just stands there and watches us suffer,\n      everyone is dying, like even the healthy people, its even worse for\n      people who have shit health\n\nprobably more, but im too lazy to name it all, worse of all -- pe is a mandatory\nclass in lithuania, meaning you can just drop it, which is depressing, after pe on\nmondays i have psychology, which is such a noisy lesson usually as the teacher\ndoesnt really control the class 'traditionally' so to say, she talks, but she never\nsays anything/much if theres kids screaming or smt, so like, im tired and anxious after\npe and then ill have to deal with a loud class \ud83d\ude2b after that its all good on monday,\n2 math classes, lunch break, 2 chems and lithuanian grammar\n\non tuesdays my first lesson is technology, like crafts and stuff, i dont mind it too\nmuch, kinda a fine lesson, then physics and 2 german classes, after that lunch break,\n2 geographies and math, this is fine\n\nomg and then we have wednesdays, 2 lithuanian literature classes, so ill be\nexhausted, after that -- patriotism, which is basically just reading articles,\nlast thing i want after 2 straight hours of reading is more reading and then\nguess what, fucking pe, pe, omfg, then lunch break and then boom, math, theyre\ntrying to kill us fr and after that its okay ig -- music and biology\n\nthursday didnt really change much so idc, but friday is \u2728 no \u2728, 2 lithuanian\nliterature classes, then art ... in the middle of the day ... i had art as my last\nclass last semester and like art is such a lesson you get really out of it after\nit and you just dont feel like doing work anymore, but then they make us do\nenglish, i mean idrc as english is quite easy for me but eh, then lunch break and then\nthe slowest teacher's class of all -- 2 histories, the history teacher is so slow,\nistg, its like watching a youtube video on 0.25 speed \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude2b like its my last\nclasses and i cant wait to go home in my last classes and they just decided to make\nthem the longest \ud83d\ude2b\n\nso yeah, fun \ud83d\udc4d\n\ni also had plans to clean and reorder my room, i still do, but i find no energy\nfor it and if i do find the energy for it, i dont have the time or if i do have both,\ni dont have the brain power for it, for example on friday i was going to do it,\nbut i was exhausted, then got energetic again, went to my grandma, came back, family\nstarted being ass to me so i logically cried myself to sleep, thats how my 'cleaning\nand reordering of my room' went, i thought i was going to do it today, no, i didnt\nhave the time for it, i went out with my best friend and we spend like 4.5 hours\npreparing for her mothers birthday, she seemed happy ( her mother, and well bsf ig )\nso im fine, came back and had no energy, i mean as of now i have more energy, but i dont\nhave the brain power for it and also its like 4 am so lol, tmrw will probably not be\nmuch diff, ill have no energy for a fact and as im not doing well emotionally rn\ni dont think thatll go away tmrw, but oh well\n\nwhen i cried myself to sleep yesterday, it was just overwhelming, i was tiredish so i was\nmuch more vulnerable to emotions, then my parents started talking shit about me, then\nmy brothers started screaming, then my middle brother begun screaming antilgbt stuff to me,\nthen they both begun doing shit to annoy me, then my brain remembered \u2728 everything \u2728\nthen just then, i could add like 10000 `then`s and it would not be enough, so to just\nsummarise, it was too much, i broke in half and didnt want to live around anyone, so i\njust went to die temporarily by going to cry and falling asleep that way\n\nthen i woke up in the morning and started this day, although first regretted waking up\nlol\n\nthen my best friend texted me and well, we went out and did the stuff, this just\nloops around now\n\nomg, this blog post is consistent, i mean i didnt start from the beginning,\nbut its also not so much of a mind clutter as the 'idk something' blog, i mean it was\nintentionally just a clusterfuck of thoughts, but this is nice, i mean i kinda like\nthat i chose to not start from the beginning, i mean it wasnt intentional, but yk,\nstill kinda cool\n\nanyway, maybe you enjoyed this carousel, i will probably continue this series, although\nidk how consistent this will be, i just want this to be a thing, cya\n",

      "description": "being a lab rat is a feeling i get quite often and i think this is a good place to share it lol",
      "content": "i have been comparing myself to a lab rat for long, so here is\nhow it feels to be a living and free lab rat living amongst people\n\nlets start from why i even call myself a lab rat, i feel like i am\none, theres no better word, i could call myself a sick person or something\nbut that doesnt describe my feelings as well as 'lab rat' does, i feel\nlike everything being done to me, doctors, medicine, mental health\nstuff, hospitals, even talking to people sometimes feels like a lab\nexperiment and i am their test lab rat, this is what i mean :\n\nwhen it comes to doctors i feel that its super invasive, everything is being\noverdone, being called things and so on, apparently being anorexic means youre\nsuper hard to look at, it feels like they picked the worst specimen to see\nwhat would happen to a weak person if they had this treatment\n\nmedicine-wise it feels like im a test subject of all drugs, i have to drink\nmany, i hate drinking them, so i dont, at this point i dont give a single\nfuck, i am tired of this lab rat feeling, it affects my whole body, not only\nmy mental health, but physically i just feel much weaker when my mind is at\nlab rat stage, im never free from it\n\nmental health too, the same thing as to doctors applies here, it feels like\ntheyre talking to me just as a weird experiment, like a lab rat being\ntalked to on drugs to see how it affects the rat or something, like some\nweird ass research project that would change something, idk\n\nhospitals feel like lab rat cages to me, 4 blank walls, maybe 1 or 2 extra\npeople in the same room, single door, quiet, sterile, controlled, fed with\ndrugs and shit food, forced, no free will, prison, a cage, a lab rat cage,\ni just cant stand that, every year i have to stay in a hospital between a 1 week\nand 2 weeks bc of heart stuff, i hate that feeling, once they had no places\nin the hospital to stay for me, they let me go home, it was nice at least\n\nand when i talk to people, sometimes, it feels like theyre just doing it\nto see what happens, to see how will i respond to certain things, like say\nsome outrageous stuff about my beliefs or identity or just talk to me\nbecause im autistic or something, it just feels like theyre poking me around\nto see what moves, what doesnt, how i react, like giving rats different drugs\nto see how it affects their problem solving ability or something, like\ngiving it a maze, drugging it and telling it to solve it again, its stupid\n\nit feels like a living nightmare being a lab rat, i feel like im constantly being\nwatched, judged and experimented on, every decision i make, every move i make,\ni feel like im being monitored and judged, i feel like im being treated like an animal,\nlike im nothing more than a lab rat\n\ni feel like im being treated like a test subject being given drugs\nto see what happens and how i respond to them, like a game of poking around,\nlike im being manipulated and controlled, like im a puppet in some\nweird ass experiment\n\nim being treated like a specimen, like im nothing more than a test subject,\na lab rat, nothing more than a piece of living flesh and a pea sized brain to be poked,\ntested, monitored and just living a life of a lab rat stuck in a cage of life\n\ni feel like im constantly being tested, examined, like im nothing more than\na lab rat in a maze covered by a glass pane, i feel like im being treated like an object,\nlike im nothing more than a tool for someone elses gain, im im a lab rat,\nnothing more than an experiment\n\nim like a rat in a cage, im being observed and studied, im nothing more than\na specimen in an experiment, not even an experiment, just random, useless\npoking around for fun, like im nothing more than a test subject in a lab,\nin a cage, covered by a white sterile drape, with wires going out and in to my brain,\nmuscles, tissue, food and water\n\nthank you for listening to this rant kinda, now you know how it feels to be a living lab\nrat in a maze of life, maybe you can relate too, maybe both of us are just 2\nsad little rats, separated by a sterile, white cloth, well never see each other,\nbut at least we coexist <3\n",

like theres absolutely nothing i can think of putting\non there, personal projects go on my own github, which is like \u2728everything\u2728 so ... do i just make\nthe org and leave it empty lol ? i mean kinda a waste, idk\n\ni keep thinking about my psychiatrist, i found a person irl who goes to the same one as i do\nand theyre not having a good time like me, my psychiatrist is like a total unqualified bitch,\nleft her a few low/terrible ratings and 1 star reviews, if i could id give her 0 stars,\nshe doesnt even deserve the 1 star, idiotic shit\n\ngonna go to my grandma tmrw maybe, i wanna go for a walk, although its already pretty\nlate so if i dont fall asleep ill probably be dead tmrw lol, either way, i have\nnot been very energetic for the past couple of months lol\n\nngl overthinking is no, i overthink a lot and i keep getting mad at myself for\na lot of things, like what could have i said and stuff yk lol, this shit is even making\nme think to stop going to my psychologist, like i overthink the psychologist sessions\n***SO MUCH*** lol\n\nwatched a video a couple of weeks ago, it was about autistic trans ppl and as im an\nautistic trans person i was interested, seems like we, the autistic ppl, are 11 times\nas likely to be trans compared to an average person, its apparently also a sign of\nautism to have issues with your gender, which makes sense as i always had issues\nwith it, sad to know that 'its just a sign', but still, i also noticed that the time\npasses by faster the older i get lol, becoming a true grandma now\n\ni told my psychologist one thing, it was something like this, just in lithuanian obviously:\n\n> ill be honest, i hide some stuff from you and other doctors, the lithuanian mental\n> healthcare system fucking SUCKS A LOT, like A LOT A LOT, i have to lie or just hide\n> things from you because i dont want to get put into a mental hospital, mental stimulation\n> depravation makes my mind go into a \"bad mode\" which is literally what a mental hospital\n> is, i lied to you multiple times already to try to not get put into one and in lithuania\n> all they do is just shove you into a mental hospital and just give 0 shits about you\n\nso yeah lmao, lithuania fucking sucks for mental shit, getting mental healthcare is hard\nenough here, but getting proper mental healthcare is *impossible*, you have to watch your\nevery word if you dont want to just get shoved into a mental hospital, its fucking idiotic\n\ni kinda like this mind cluster-fuck of a blog post, its nice just thinking of shit and\njust typing it out lol\n\na person gave me a question idr how long ago but it was\n\n> if youre so depressed why dont you kill yourself already\n\nwell, i still want to see what life can offer until my ultimate demise, i mean\nso far it isnt anything good lol, but oh well\n\nwas watching my hands like a week ago and i found that they look a lot like frog hands, like\nthe bones and shit, fingers, just  f r o g  lol\n\ntoday i saw how bloated rust is, so, i shrunk my `/` part to `20 GB` few days ago and it was\nfine and uh, i decided to start my system update today and rust source code takes up 11+ GB\nof storage, funny because firefox takes up much less while being a much more complex program,\ngod, rust is a fucking disappointment lol\n\nremember how i was bald last year ? i was gonna shave my head again, then decided not\nto lol, it was a whole mess, i was scared, thought id probably feel good for a split\nsecond, but then like shit and then just polls and shit and ugh it was a mess, i just\ndecided to keep my hair, glad i did\n\nhm, im digging deeper and deeper into my brain, we went from christmas to this, interesting,\ni mean thats kinda what this blog is, me digging deeper and deeper into my 1 braincell width\nbrain lol\n\nim confused why ppl still use arigram, a telegram client i made, i mean its nice and stuff\nbut its kinda a deadish project, i dont work on it anymore, meaning the new stuff telegram\nadds is just going to show up as `[MessageUnsupported]` which isnt useful is it lol, i rlly\nneed to change the arigram api to work better with the new telegram shit dynamically lol, i\nmean i literally use arigram myself and it doesnt bother me but i mean others might not be\nable to work with it as well as i can lol\n\nlol im still on the `5.16.7` kernel, i dont like `5.15.x` and the new kernel sucks so im\nsticking to the old one and probably never updating, that is *if* im even staying on linux\nlol, remember, the netbsd/openbsd thing ?\n\nwhy does PE *(physical 'education')* even exist, 'movement' my ass, i came to school not to\n'move' but to learn and get a diploma, i literally am so exhausted after PE, can barely learn,\ni fucking hate PE, it makes me feel like shit in so many ways i cant, at times i even begin\nto cry BECAUSE i have PE that day, its stupid stupid lol, reasons why i hate pe:\n\n- dysphoria\n- exhaustion\n- pure depression\n- the general fucking feel of the 'lesson'\n- pointless 'lesson'\n- i fucking hate pe\n- i fucking hate pe\n- i fucking hate pe\n\ni might still be falling for my crush and ppl know lol, worst part is that were classmates,\nand like omg, why, i WANT to get over him but i just \u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728cannot\u2728\u2728\u2728\u2728 lol, i have\na hard time dropping feelings for ppl\n\nanyway i think this clusterfuck of a blog is good enough to be posted if you decide\nto say anything abt it dont scream kthxbye\n",

      "description": "gnu bash optimization tips, and overall code, but mainly bash bc thats sometimes important lol",
      "content": "Over the years that I have been programming I had quite a few\nmoments when I had to optimise code, so today I have decided to share\nhow I do it, you might find this useful\n\n## BASH script optimisation\n\n> Note: A lot of these points can be also applied to the next\n> section\n\n-   Avoid forks and sub-shells, it might not look like much but it **_REALLY_** impacts\n    your program's performance, like... By a lot, so avoid them\n    -   Prefer using built-in BASH commands (<#:Example 1>)\n        rather than calling external commands\n        - Some `builtin`s are faster than others (<#:Example 12>)\n    -   Prefer using the `-v` syntax rather than using a sub-shell, capturing\n        the output and saving it, by `-v` syntax I mean\n        a command writing _directly_ to the variable (<#:Example 2>)\n    -   Prefer using native BASH rather than calling commands (<#:Example 3>)\n-   Avoid looping, as in any interpreted programming language it's slow to\n    loop in BASH\n-   Avoid complex commands (<#:Example 4>)\n    -   Avoid complexity in general even if it sacrifices ease (<#:Example 5>)\n    -   Be smart about the commands you call, call simpler ones (<#:Example 6>)\n-   Less is more, if you're not using BASH features, why not stick to `sh` ?\n    It's faster, or even use some other POSIX complient shell, for example DASH\n    or KSH\n-   If your code is being `source`d or in general, why not have a pre-processing\n    or build step, for example let's say you have optional logging enabled by some\n    environment variable, why not make that build-time, for example\n    <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/baz> does it, strip away comments and stuff\n    -   While you're at it, why not mangle names at build time to\n        be shorter ? Shorter scripts from what I know run _slightly_ faster\n        as BASH has to read less and parse less\n-   Avoid disk I/O (<#:Example 7>)\n-   Store data in variables rather than generating it over and over again\n    for example BASH escapes `$'\\n'`, it gives a _very slight_ performance\n    boost (<#:Example 8>)\n-   Prefer doing everything in one rather than one-by-one (<#:Example 9>)\n\n## General code optimisation\n\n-   Prefer compilation, transpilation or pre-evaluation over\n    pure interpretation\n    -   Even if the transpilation is into bytecode, it doesn't matter,\n        it'll still be faster than pure interpretation, for example\n        python bytecode is faster than raw python\n-   Buffering is underrated, calling many `syscall`s is expensive,\n    have a larger buffer instead ! (<#:Example 10>)\n-   Prioritise simplicity over ease, abstractions often cause\n    more complex code\n-   Use low level code, it's much faster than pure abstractions\n    -   Low level code gives you more control and is closer\n        to hardware meaning is much faster than machine-generated\n        assembly with preparation steps and things, you can do\n        just what you want with low level code, although it's not\n        easier, simple, but not easy\n-   Prefer smaller size, smaller assembly instructions and registers\n-   Find faster ways to do things, there always is at least one\n    (<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1135679/does-using-xor-reg-reg-give-advantage-over-mov-reg-0>)\n-   Prefer doing less for a similar result (<#:Example 11>)\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1\n\n    x=\"$(cat -- /etc/passwd)\"\n\nFaster:\n\n    x=\"$(</etc/passwd)\"\n\n### Example 2\n\n    greet() { echo \"Hello, $1\"; }\n\n    x=\"$(greet 'ari')\"\n    echo \"$x\"\n\nFaster:\n\n    greet() {\n        local -n _r=\"$1\"\n        shift 1\n\n        printf -v _r \"Hello, %s\" \"$1\"\n    }\n\n    greet x 'ari'\n    echo \"$x\"\n\n### Example 3\n\n    x=\"Hel o\"\n    echo \"$x\" | sed 's/ /l/'\n\nFaster:\n\n    x=\"Hel o\"\n    echo \"${x/ /l}\"\n\n### Example 4\n\n    printf '%s\\n' 'hey'\n\nFaster:\n\n    echo 'hey'\n\n### Example 5\n\n    x=()\n\n    while read -r line; do\n        x+=(\"$line\")\n    done <file\n\nFaster:\n\n    mapfile -t x <file\n\n### Example 6\n\n    sed '1!d' file\n\nFaster:\n\n    head -n1 file\n\n### Example 7\n\n    id >/tmp/x\n    echo \"Info: $(</tmp/x)\"\n    rm -f /tmp/x\n\nFaster:\n\n    echo \"Info: $(id)\"\n\n### Example 8\n\n    for _ in $(seq 10000); do\n        echo \"Hello\"$'\\n'\"world\"\n    done\n\nFaster:\n\n    nl=$'\\n'\n\n    for _ in $(seq 10000); do\n        echo \"Hello${nl}world\"\n    done\n\n### Example 9\n\n    while read -r line; do\n        echo \"$line\"\n    done <file\n\nFaster:\n\n    echo \"$(<file)\"\n\n### Example 10\n\n    format ELF64 executable 3\n    segment readable executable\n\n    _start:\n        ;; 2 syscalls per char\n\n        mov eax, 0\n        mov edi, 0\n        mov esi, buf\n        mov edx, 1\n        syscall\n\n        test eax, eax\n        jz .exit\n\n        mov eax, 1\n        mov edi, 1\n        mov esi, buf\n        mov edx, 1\n        syscall\n\n        jmp _start\n\n    .exit:\n        mov rax, 60\n        mov rdi, 0\n        syscall\n\n    segment readable writable\n        buf: rb 1\n\nFaster:\n\n    format ELF64 executable 3\n    segment readable executable\n\n    _start:\n        ;; 2 syscalls per 1024 chars\n\n        mov eax, 0\n        mov edi, 0\n        mov esi, buf\n        mov edx, 1024\n        syscall\n\n        test eax, eax\n        jz .exit\n\n        mov edx, eax\n\n        mov eax, 1\n        mov edi, 1\n        mov esi, buf\n        syscall\n\n        jmp _start\n\n    .exit:\n        mov rax, 60\n        mov rdi, 0\n        syscall\n\n    segment readable writable\n        buf: rb 1024\n\n### Example 11\n\n    int x = 0;\n    x = 0;\n    x = 1;\n    x--;\n    x++;\n\nFaster:\n\n    int x = 1;\n\n### Example 12\n\n    content=\"$(cat /etc/passwd)\"\n\nFaster:\n\n    content=\"$(</etc/passwd)\"\n\nFaster:\n\n    mapfile -d '' content </etc/passwd\n    content=\"${content[*]%$'\\n'}\"\n\nFaster:\n\n    read -rd '' content </etc/passwd\n\n^ This exists with code `1`, so just add a `|| :` at the end if that's unwanted behaviour\n",

      "description": "a tutorial on how to make ur first website",
      "content": "A lot of people want to have a personal space and property on the internet,\nbut a lot of them don't know how... So today I'm going to be showing you\nhow you should go about making a website\n\nAlso, you should not straight up copy everything here,\nyou should just read it and use it as a rough outline, you should\nnever copy off tutorials or anything of sort\n\n## Tl;Dr\n\n> Keep it minimal, simple and avoid using bloat, also make sure to\n> keep going rather than giving up, learn rather than use some shit\n> service, experience with code also helps\n\n## Have prior programming experience\n\nYou'll need to have prior programming experience to understand what is really\ngoing on even though nor HTML nor CSS (the bare base of your website) are programming\nlanguages, many answers you'll find online will also use terminology that you won't\nunderstand if you don't have at least a bit of it\n\nEven if you don't have prior programming experience, please don't resort to website\nbuilders or static site generators, it won't teach you anything, rather\nlearn some programming language like python or even JavaScript, JavaScript alongside\nHTML and CSS is a huge part of the web stack\n\nAnyway, if you don't have any experience, gain some and then come back, unless\nyou want to just have a read, then go ahead :) Although without it, you won't\nget too far probably\n\n## Learn basic HTML and CSS\n\nFirst up, before you can do anything you'll probably want to learn HTML,\nto style it you'll probably want to learn CSS, although I have recommend\nthis to many people, they seem to not understand what learning is, they\nfind a tutorial and copy off it and then end up using inline `style` attrs\nor `style` tags in html, they begin making their HTML messy and invalid\nand generally make their site so messy and broken it becomes an unmaintanable\nmess, so what you should do\n\n-   Learn what HTML and CSS are, you need like 10 mins to look up the definitions and stuff\n-   Learn HTML\n    -   It can be learned in max 2 hours, a good tutorial I recommend: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQN-pnXPaVg>\n    -   Don't copy from the tutorial, make sure to understand what you're doing\n-   Learn CSS\n    -   Look up a basic tutorial (e.g. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PnVor36_40>)\n    -   Once again **_DON'T COPY_**, understand and do\n\nOnce you have the bare minimum, make a simple HTML document and save it,\nthis will serve you the purpose of archiving your progress and you'll be able to\nsee how much you reached in like a month\n\nTo help you get started, here's quite a good template to start with:\n\n    <!DOCTYPE html>\n    <html lang=\"en\">\n        <head>\n            <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n            <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\n            <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n            <title>Your title</title>\n\n            <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Your description\" />\n            <meta\n                name=\"keywords\"\n                content=\"your, keywords, idk something, website, aaaa\"\n            />\n            <meta\n                name=\"robots\"\n                content=\"follow, index, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large\"\n            />\n            <meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"website\" />\n\n            <meta name=\"color-scheme\" content=\"dark\" />\n            <!-- ^^^ dark theme -->\n\n            <link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/manifest.json\" />\n        </head>\n\n        <body>\n            <!-- Your markup -->\n        </body>\n    </html>\n\n## JavaScript\n\nJavaScript is a programming language made for the web, or at least is a huge part of the\nweb stack, but these days it can run even serverside code using nodejs, but JavaScript (JS/js)\nis quite painful to code in, so if you want a better experience with programming on\nthe internet for your website try TypeScript (TS/ts) out\n\nYou'll use JavaScript to handle logic on your website, for example if you want to check\nwhat a user has entered in a text box or managing state(s)\n\nAlthough JS or TS are more than optional, hell, even CSS is optional,\nbut if you want to make your site at least slightly nice you'll probably want\n_at least_ CSS\n\n## Never say \"it's too hard\"\n\nAfter all of this, many people (including quite a few of my friends) would (or are) say\n\"it's too hard\" and resort to using some site builder with WIX or use a static site\ngenerator which bloats up your site to unbelievable levels, \"it's easier\" you'll say,\neven though this will end up making your site low-key shit and you'll have to deliver\nmegabytes of content to your website visitors which is not pleasant for anyone, nor you\nhosting it (we'll get to it later) nor the user visiting it, especially if they have\na bad internet connection, it doesn't teach you anything either, just bad in general,\nplease keep pushing, you can do it\n\nAlso, most web frameworks also cost a shit-ton of money and have mannnyyy hidden\nfees and spyware, so just stay away from them\n\n## Avoid frameworks\n\nFrameworks, although useful when you understand what everything means, don't teach you\nanything, and once again bloat up your site\n\n## Separate and track your learning\n\nBy separating and tracking your learning progress you'll see how much\nyou reached, how you improved and what you did to improve, you will also\nhave a great resource to\n\n## Manual is better (usually)\n\nIf you do most things manually (as in not using too many frameworks) you'll gain more\nknowledge and make your site smaller and simpler overall, I prefer to do things manually\nand I made my site quite small, while frameworks (e.g. react or bootstrap (they are not comparable, but just examples))\ntend to be huuuuggggeee in size, meaning your users will have to a) depend on 3rd party\ncode and make your site worse and even then, if you're using the framework you are,\nyou're learning the framework, not the actual logic (e.g. if you're using bootstrap, you're\nlearning bootstrap, not CSS)\n\nAlthough, note the _(usually)_, for example this blog is generated by my own\nstatic site generator which optimises stuff and makes it accessible for everyone,\nit doesn't bloat anything up, so if you have something like this (a blog), I'd\nsuggest writing your own or using a small static site generator, at least from\nthat you learn something\n\nThis blog generator is quite simple, creation of a blog is like\n\n> Markdown + text -> base64 encoding -> JSON\n\nAnd generation\n\n> JSON -> base64 decoder -> markdown -> HTML -> minification -> index.html file in a designated directory\n\n## Writing your site\n\nAfter all of this, you probably have few documents you can refer to,\nthis will be a great resource for you if you forget something, but don't be\nscared to look things up, it's normal and a part of a developer's experience,\nnobody, and I mean _nobody_ in 2022 knows how to center a div without\nlooking it up lol\n\nBut, besides that, here's a few tips to help you\n\n-   Automate only if needed\n    -   For example if you have something like a blog with many pages\n-   Don't focus on SEO, this will only make your site worse\n    -   Although basic SEO is fine, like adding a `sitemap.xml` or `robots.txt` or something\n    -   Don't add like a milion `meta` tags too, just like 10 at max is good enough\n-   Focus on A11y (accessibility), because it's quite important for your site to be accessible to anyone, try using:\n    -   Semantic elements\n    -   CSS media queries\n    -   Accessible design\n    -   ARIA attrs\n-   Less is more, don't (over)use (over)complicated logic and frameworks with huge sizes, use little to get the result you desire\n-   Every little thing matters, especially on the web, every little bit of performance matters\n    -   Asset optimisation is good, but make sure to not overdo it to the point only the newest browsers can run it\n        -   For example asset optimisation _at build time_ is an amazing example of much needed asset optimisation,\n            although optional if you don't really care\n        -   Server-side gzip compression also helps\n        -   Image compression helps, quite a needed one especially if you have many images\n        -   Bundling can and does help, but isn't super major and plus can break some functionality\n    -   And don't forget about logic and CSS optimisation\n-   Don't add tracking, it just introduces security vulns, bloat, distrust and general bad things\n-   New technology can wait, let it develop and be supported amongst more browsers\n-   Just like when you were learning, don't be scared to separate content into different folders and files\n    -   Fun thing: if you want a page without `.html` at the end just, make a directory with the page name you want and\n        have `index.html` in it, but your server might support doing that automatically :)\n-   Have a place to test and run your site temporally\n    -   A dev server is important, because `file://` is usually not a good place to test it, use like [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server), I use it and I like it personally\n-   Use a VCS\n    -   Although doesn't _mean_ you have to make it open source (although you should (we'll talk about it)),\n        you should still use a VCS, `git` is probably the most popular one, while building your site you're going to have many fuck-ups\n        and you'll want to say \"eh, fuck it\" and reset all of your changes, well, without a VCS.. Good luck lol\n        -   But this means you will have to learn a VCS, no, a VCS is not 'press upload button to GitHub', use the CLI\n\nThese are some things I could thing of, I use them all lol, anyway, let's continue\n\n## Open source\n\nMany people would say 'WhO tHe fUcK nEEdS thE sOurCE cODe oF A sItE' and that's just an idiotic\nmindset to say the least, anyway, here's some good things that come with making your website\nopen source\n\n-   You're helping the open source community grow\n-   You're showing all changes you make to the public\n-   It's basically free advertising\n-   You show what your site does to the public, meaning it creates the feeling of trust\n-   You feel more accomplished when you show something to people and they like it\n\n> _also if your point of not making it open source is just 'just open the dev tools'\n> you're stupid, but you know what, okay then, send me the source code of google\n> to my email, would be appreciated.. Oh waitttt you can't because it's not the full\n> assets, it's obfuscated and minified and plus it's probably modified_\n\n## Hosting\n\nHosting is when you actually let people see the stuff you made, hosting your code is one thing,\nbut hosting your site is another, I personally use [netlify](https://netlify.com/), it's an amazing, free and non-scummy\nplatform for hosting your _static_ site, it also provides amazing [documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/),\n[help](https://answers.netlify.com/) and [customisation](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/)\nand all of this for free, although more limiting, a good choice is also [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/) or [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/)\npages\n\nAlthough I think out of those 3 netlify is the best choice for _static_ sites :)\n\nBut if you want something server-side, I doubt you'll be able to find anything\nfree, but this is not a\n\n## Publicising and sharing\n\nDon't be annoying about it and don't shove it into everyone's face, just add it to\nyour bio, put it on something like [wiby](https://wiby.me/) and be happy, it's not a competition,\njust make fun things and people will like it :)\n\nYou can also share it with your friends and other strangers which are interested\n\n## What can you do on your site\n\n-   Host files\n-   Make a blog\n-   Have fun with code\n-   Explore random frameworks (when you already know what you're doing)\n-   Talk to people\n-   Share your projects, thoughts and opinions\n-   Learn !\n\n## Don't allow people to get in your way\n\nNot everyone is going to like your site, if they call it shit, who cares,\nit's your place to do anything, for example would you burn your house down if\nsomeone didn't like it, it's yours, you're good with it and you need to enjoy\nit, it's your own property, just virtual\n\n## Domain name\n\nDomain names are _really_ optional as most hosting services provide\na subdomain, e.g. <https://ari-web.netlify.app/>, but you might like having\nyour domain like <https://ari-web.xyz/> which is shorter and just nicer,\nfor domains you will have to pay, for example buy it from <https://namecheap.com/>,\nbut there are services which provide free domains to people, those domains\nhave very low value though, like .tk and .ga are usually flagged as untrustworthy\nand don't grow as fast\n\nAfter you get a domain name you might want to set up HTTPS (if you don't already\nhave it) and submit it to the HSTS preload list which will ensure the security\nof users visiting your site\n\n## That's about it\n\nWell... That's about it, it's a long process and getting it more popular is even\nharder, but don't try hard, don't be annoying about it to people and just make\nthings you like and people will find it, anyway, hope you found this blog useful\nand I inspired you to join the web world, hope to see another web neighbour in the\nnear future :)\n\nHave a nice day and goodbye :)\n",

Try `kos`,\nit's smaller than `doas` and obviously `sudo`, much faster, doesn't use PAM,\nquite secure from what I see, has good compile-time customisation and\ngenerally is a good alternative to at least `doas`, it works for me, works\nfor many other people so should work for you :)\n\nI personally have been using it for quite a while and it's good,\ntry it out if you feel like it :)\n\n-   Ari-web redirect: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/kos>\n-   Direct GitHub link: <https://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/kos>\n-   Gentoo package: <https://ari-web.xyz/gentooatom/app-admin/kos>\n-   Arch package: <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/kos>\n\n## `Lmgr` license manager\n\nI find it so annoying to manually license every single one of my projects,\nI now use `lmgr`, I just got a bunch of license templates set up and it's\neasy, I'm happy I made it\n\n-   Ari-web redirect: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/lmgr>\n-   Direct GitHub link: <https://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/lmgr>\n-   Gentoo package: <https://ari-web.xyz/gentooatom/app-misc/lmgr>\n\n## `Mkproj` project templater\n\nAlongside `lmgr`, `mkproj` comes in handy, it's super annoying to me personally\ndo things manually and if I want to make a project `mkproj` really helps lol\n\n-   Ari-web redirect: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/mkproj>\n-   Direct GitHub link: <https://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/mkproj>\n-   Gentoo package: <https://ari-web.xyz/gentooatom/app-misc/mkproj>\n\n## `Mkqemuvm` -- the small QEMU wrapper\n\nI usually don't change my QEMU vm options that often so I just made a script\nto help me make QEMU VMs easily:\n\n-   Ari-web redirect: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/mkqemuvm>\n-   Direct GitHub link: <https://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/mkqemuvm>\n-   Gentoo package: <https://ari-web.xyz/gentooatom/app-emulation/mkqemuvm>\n\n## `Pwdtools` tools for passwords\n\n`pwdtools` is another thing I quite often use, I use it to generate, store\nsometimes validate the security of passwords, it's nice, quite useful\n\nThis includes 2 password validators, password generator and a password manager,\nmight add more :)\n\n-   Ari-web redirect: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/pwdtools>\n-   Direct GitHub link: <https://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/pwdtools>\n-   Gentoo package: <https://ari-web.xyz/gentooatom/app-admin/pwdtools>\n\n## `Filetools` tools for files\n\nAlthough `filetools` isn't as useful to me, it's nice to get good info about\ncertain files, like permissions, path info, owner, size, etc. super nice\nfor development too\n\n-   Ari-web redirect: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/filetools>\n-   Direct GitHub link: <https://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/filetools>\n-   Gentoo package: <https://ari-web.xyz/gentooatom/app-admin/filetools>\n\n## `Bdwmb` -- the modular bar for DWM\n\nThe heading says it all, it's a simple, small and nice bar for\nDWM window manager, I use it, I like it lol\n\n-   Ari-web redirect: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/bdwmb>\n-   Direct GitHub link: <https://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/bdwmb>\n-   Gentoo package: <https://ari-web.xyz/gentooatom/x11-misc/bdwmb>\n\n---\n\nThat's about it, although this is definably not all, just most major, I also\nrun my own stuff on top of those so my system is basically just my software,\nanyway, hope I introduced you to some of my software somewhat, anyway, have a\ngood day :)\n\nGoodbye\n",

      "description": "mpv is my beloved player so i decided to collect some shit on myself lol",
      "content": "## Before we start\n\nThis blog is not updated, I made this whole thing into a baz\nplugin: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/mpvp-report>\n\nA day ago I started collecting data about what I listen to\non my playlist, and currently it's working out amazing, it's very\nfun, so I thought to myself, 'why not share it', so here\nyou go\n\n## 1. Set up `mpvp` alias\n\n`mpvp` alias is what you will have to use to collect data about\nyour playlist, you can set up another name but code should be\naround the same\n\nBasically, add this to your `~/.bashrc`:\n\n    mpvp_collect() {\n        [ ! -f \"$HOME/.mpvp\" ] && : >\"$HOME/.mpvp\"\n\n        sleep 2\n\n        while true; do\n            sleep 5\n\n            x=\"$(echo '{ \"command\": [\"get_property\", \"path\"] }' | socat - /tmp/mpvipc)\"\n\n            [ ! \"$x\" ] && break\n\n            if [ \"$x\" ] && [ \"$x\" != \"$(tail -n 1 \"$HOME/.mpvp\")\" ]; then\n                sleep 4\n\n                y=\"$(echo '{ \"command\": [\"get_property\", \"path\"] }' | socat - /tmp/mpvipc)\"\n                [ \"$x\" = \"$y\" ] && echo \"$x\" >>\"$HOME/.mpvp\"\n            fi\n        done\n    }\n\n    alias mpvp='mpvp_collect & mpv --shuffle --loop-playlist --input-ipc-server=/tmp/mpvipc'\n\nWhen you use the `mpvp` alias it'll start the data collector in the background,\nthe IPC will be accessible though `/tmp/mpvipc`, this will collect all\ndata to `~/.mpvp`, listen to some music and ignore it for a bit, also, keep in mind,\nthis code is bad because I'm too lazy to improve it and I made it fast, anyway, you\nneed to install `socat` for this to work\n\n## 2. Generate data report\n\nWell at this point you can do anything you want with your data, although\nI made a simple generator for it\n\nSo I made use of the data I have and my playlist structure, here's an example entry:\n\n    {\"data\":\"playlist/girl in red - i'll die anyway. [8MMa35B3HT8].mp3\",\"request_id\":0,\"error\":\"success\"}\n\nThere's an ID there so I add YouTube adding to the generator by\ndefault, yours might not have it, but I mean, you can still pretty much\nuse it, just links won't work\n\n### 2.1 The script\n\nI made a python script as my generator:\n\n    #!/usr/bin/env python3\n    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\n    \"\"\"MPV playlist song

from, run the script,\njust\n\n    python3 main.py\n\nOr whatever, it'll generate `index.html` file and it'll include all of\nyour report data, you can also style it using the `styles` variable\n\n## 3. Finishing\n\nThat's all, enjoy your statistics, and as of now I shall go collect more data,\nI already have 18KB of it!\n\nPlus, I'll admit it, most of this code is **garbage, complete dog shit**,\nI just wanted to make it work and I did, it's readable enough\nfor just a messy script I'm not even releasing as anything legit\n",

      "content": "Ari-web APIs recently have become public, meaning\nanyone can use them on anywhere, so, how should you\nuse them properly?\n\n## 1. Validate hashes\n\nAll APIs have hashes for validation, and APIs are much more\nexpensive to call than just comparing two hashes\n\nFirst up make an uncached request, cache the request, then\nmake a request to get the calculated hash, cache it too\n\nNext time only make a request to get the hash, if the hashes\nmatch, if they do, use the cached API response, if it does\nnot match, get the updated data, cache it and so on\n\n### Hashes\n\nThe hashes are sha256 sums of the APIs, here's all the APIs\nhashing system\n\n-   <https://files.ari-web.xyz/files.json>\n    -   Just make a request to <https://files.ari-web.xyz/files_json_hash.txt>\n-   <https://blog.ari-web.xyz/blog.json>\n    -   Just make a request to <https://blog.ari-web.xyz/blog_json_hash.txt>\n-   <https://www.ari-web.xyz/api>\n    -   Just make a request to <https://www.ari-web.xyz/api_hash/..._hash.txt> with the `...` being the API name with all `.` characters replaced with `_`, for example for <https://www.ari-web.xyz/api/sitelist.json> would be <https://www.ari-web.xyz/api_hash/sitelist_json_hash.txt>\n-   <https://etc.ari-web.xyz/pages.json>\n    -   Just make a request to <https://etc.ari-web.xyz/pages_json_hash.txt>\n\nThis is already a standard in Ari-web, also if `www` subdomains don't work,\ntry out removing `www`\n\n## 2. Make as little requests as you can\n\nThis is kinda an extension of point 1, just don't make 10\nrequests to every API if you only need the `sitelist.json` once for\nexample\n\n## That's it\n\nThat's it, I got nothing else, this whole blog could have been\njust\n\n    Make as little and I mean AS LITTLE requests as possible to the APIs\n",

      "content": "So before we start, I have my own overlay @ <https://ari-web.xyz/overlay>\nand am running it for a while, it was a bit painful for me to\nmake one at the start and to help new Gentoo users I am making this\nblog post, anyway, here's how you do it:\n\n## Step one -- Think of a name\n\nThink of a name you will give your overlay because this information\nwill be needed in later steps\n\n## Step two -- Folder structure\n\nTo start with we need files and folders to work with,\nall names ending with a `/` are folders and everything\nelse is a file, please make sure to also apply the templates\nin `<...>`, for example `<year>` would be the current year:\n\n    ./\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 metadata/\n    \u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 layout.conf\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 overlays.xml\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 profiles/\n    \u2502  \u2514\u2500\u2500 repo_name\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 repositories.xml\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 sets/\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 sets.conf\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 <overlay name>.conf\n\n## Step three -- License\n\nThe `LICENSE` file should have your license, if it doesn't\nalready please pick one, for example on my overlay\nI went for [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), but you can also go for some other\n_open source_ licenses, like GPLv2, WTFPL, BSD 3-clause, etc.\n\nWrite that license to the `LICENSE` file\n\n## Step four -- Master overlays\n\nThis step is always the same, you have to set the master\noverlay in `metadata/layout.conf` file, the master is usually\ngoing to be `gentoo`, so in `metadata/layout.conf` add this\ncontent:\n\n    masters = gentoo\n\n## Step five -- Overlay index files\n\nOverlay index files are these files:\n\n- `overlays.xml`\n- `repositories.xml`\n\nBoth of these files should have the same content,\nmake sure to fill in the templates that are in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE:\n\n    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n    <!DOCTYPE repositories SYSTEM \"https://www.gentoo.org/dtd/repositories.dtd\">\n    <repositories xmlns=\"\" version=\"1.0\">\n        <repo quality=\"experimental\" status=\"unofficial\">\n            <name><![CDATA[OVERLAY_NAME]]></name>\n            <description lang=\"en\"><![CDATA[OVERLAY_DESCRIPTION]]></description>\n            <homepage>OVERLAY_HOMEPAGE</homepage>\n            <owner type=\"project\">\n                <email>OWNER_EMAIL</email>\n                <name><![CDATA[OWNER_FULL_NAME]]></name>\n            </owner>\n\n            <!--\n                Optional (this is an example because it's hard to template it):\n\n                <source type=\"git\">https://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/dinolay.git</source>\n                <source type=\"git\">git://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/dinolay.git</source>\n                <source type=\"git\">git@github.com:TruncatedDinosour/dinolay.git</source>\n                <feed>https://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/dinolay/commits/main.atom</feed>\n            -->\n        </repo>\n    </repositories>\n\nOnce again, don't forget that all of these files have the same exact content,\nand no, it cannot be a symlink AFAIK\n\n## Step six -- Profiles\n\nYou only need one file in the `profiles` folder -- `repo_name`,\nthe content of it should be your overlay name, for example:\n\n    dinolay\n\nThis is the `repo_name` content on my own overlay, basically the\ntemplate is\n\n    <overlay name>\n\n## Step seven -- Readme\n\n`README.md` is an optional file, it's just used for information to give to users,\nit can have any content but here's a nice template:\n\n    # <overlay name>\n\n    > <overlay description>\n\n    ## Installation\n\n    ### Manual\n\n    ```bash\n    $ sudo mkdir -p /etc/portage/repos.conf\n    $ sudo cp <overlay name>.conf /etc/portage/repos.conf/<overlay name>.conf\n    $ sudo emerge --sync '<overlay name>'\n    ```\n\n    ### Eselect repository\n\n    ```bash\n    $ sudo eselect repository add '<overlay name>' '<overlay sync method (e.g. git)>' '<overlay sync url>'\n    $ sudo eselect repository enable '<overlay name>'\n    $ sudo emerge --sync '<overlay name>'\n    ```\n\nAnd once you get into the [Offical Gentoo API](https://api.gentoo.org/), for example\n[Like I did](https://github.com/gentoo/api-gentoo-org/pull/459) you also add how to add your overlay through\n[layman](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Layman):\n\n    ### Layman\n\n    ```bash\n    $ sudo layman -a '<overlay name>'\n    $ sudo layman -s '<overlay name>'\n    ```\n\n## Step eight -- Sets\n\nThis directory is optional, although you can have sets\nof packages in there, like have you ever heard a term called\n'world set', it's the same thing, just on your own overlay\n\n[Read more about it here](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Package_sets)\n\n## Step nine -- Sets configuration\n\nThis file is needed unlike the sets directory, you should\nhave this content in it, although once again, please don't\nforget to fill in the template:\n\n    [<overlay name> sets]\n    class = portage.sets.files.StaticFileSet\n    multiset = true\n    directory = ${repository:<overlay name>}/sets/\n\n## Step ten -- Portage overlay configuration\n\nThis file, although optional, will help the users of your\noverlay so much, they can just download this file,\nput it in `/etc/portage/repos.conf/<repo name>.conf` and then\nrun\n\n    sudo emerge --sync '<repo name>'\n\nAnd they have it installed, anyway, this is what that file\nshould have\n\n    [<overlay name>]\n    location = /var/db/repos/<overlay name>\n    sync-type = <overlay sync type>\n    sync-uri = <overlay sync url>\n\nE.g. for git it'd be:\n\n    [<overlay name>]\n    location = /var/db/repos/<overlay name>\n    sync-type = git\n    sync-uri = https://some.git.service/me/my-overlay.git\n\n## Finishing\n\nAnd that's it, you can now publish your overlay on for example\nGitHub, like I did on <https://ari-web.xyz/overlay>, it's very easy,\nif you are confused about anything, refer to that repo yourself\n",

      "content": "## Projects\n\nDon't ask me about the names, ari-web came from how I name my hostnames\nwhile using Linux distros like ari-<distro\\> so it only makes sense that\nari-web would be for my website ig, other names I just made up ig, I really\nhave 0 clue what they mean but yeah, also I only created my GitHub account\nin 2020/09/10, meaning I have not released too much, usually my projects used\nto be smaller scale, the most I did was share them on discord or something,\nbut also there's the issue that I have deleted over 50 of them from github\nbecause they're.. Very useless\n\n- Ari-web things\n    - [Main page](https://ari-web.xyz/) -- The actual main page, source code: <https://ari-web.xyz/git>\n    - [Blog](https://blog.ari-web.xyz/) -- My.. Blog ig lol, but actually is managed and built unlike the legacy counterpart, source code: <https://blog.ari-web.xyz/git>\n        - [Legacy blog](https://legacy.blog.ari-web.xyz/)-- Why do people even read this, I have not updated it in like half a year, source code: <https://legacy.blog.ari-web.xyz/git>\n    - [Comments and opinions](https://user.ari-web.xyz/) -- Literally just a static page using uterances for people to comment stuff on rather than flooding me with github issues, source code: <https://user.ari-web.xyz/git> (nothing interesting)\n    - [School stuff](https://school.ari-web.xyz) -- Very bad and cringe, also not foss\n    - [(Mainly personal) File hosting](https://files.ari-web.xyz/) -- A place where I upload files because using conventional file uploading services like filebin is annoying because they have like an md5 hash as their file id, src: <https://files.ari-web.xyz/git>\n    - [Three](https://3.ari-web.xyz/) -- Yeah, just 3 :) src: <https://3.ari-web.xyz/git>\n- My dotfiles: <https://ari-web.xyz/dotfiles>\n- My [Gentoo Linux](https://gentoo.org/) overlay: <https://ari-web.xyz/overlay>\n- A quite simple sudo alternative for _purely_ Linux (bc I suck and I don't use BSD yet, will be painful to port but eh, we'll see (yes I actually use it)) written in C++: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/kos>\n- A TUI telegram client people seem to love but like it's not working with any modern features because I have not worked on it properly in like 9 months: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/arigram>\n- Yafetch's fork, same name, just a completely reworked build system and I do active porting to newer lua versions: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/yafetch>\n- A bot I made for CollabVM when I was actually active on it, just a simple websocket client ig, just specifically for CollabVM: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/abot>\n- I needed a GNU BASH plugin manager which doesn't take 3 hours to start up and load all the plugins so I made my own, actually I do that often, whenever I can't find proper software that fits me, I just make my own: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/baz>\n- Youtube CLI client I guess, some people seem to like it, although it's quite meh, there are many better alternatives, I still use it from time to time: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/myt>\n- A purely POSIX sh functional daemon manager on top of SysVinit: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/arci>\n- Some tools I use for generating passwords, validating them, etc. I like my passwords strong: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/pwdtools>\n- Licence manager, quite useful, purely POSIX sh, I find using it quite a lot because I really don't want to go manually find and fill in licence templates: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/pwdtools>\n- SearX meta-search-engine CLI, as you can tell I really like CLI tools, my terminal is my literal life, I use it sometimes too i guess: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/searx-cli>\n- A simple package manager for the R programming language: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/cran>\n- Make projects from templates, I use it as often as I use lmgr, because I hate doing things manually if I can easily automate it: https://ari-web.xyz/gh/mkproj\n- Random\n    - A fork of vimbuddy script to make it cuter ig: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/vimbuddy.vim>\n    - A fork of google's codefm for vim which has many more formatters and a less complicated contribution system: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/vim-codefmt>\n    - My go at some of the coreutils, I barely work on it though: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/sm-coreutils>\n    - A bar script for DWM window manager: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/bdwmb>\n    - My build of the Linux kernel: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/dino-kernel>\n    - A build of DWM for the EndeavourOS GNU/Linux distribution made by me: <https://ari-web.xyz/gh/enDWMvour>\n    - The coffee theme organization: <https://github.com/coffee-theme/>\n\nPlus a bunch others, some private, some unreleased, some just too small to share lol, some just have\nbad code, actually some of that bad code is intentional, so like I got obsessed with stack based languages\nand I got 2 attempts at making 2:\n\n- [Rys](https://ari-web.xyz/gh/rys)\n- [Fa](https://ari-web.xyz/gh/fa)\n\nAll of them use python as a bootstrap and had a plan to self-host, Rys is just dead although Fa I'm pretty\nsure is turing complete, also I think it's possible to self-host it, I'm just too lazy to do so, also too\nlazy to prove its turing compleeness, the reason why the code is bad is because I literally did not try,\n'It's just a stupid script to what will disappear after some time' I thought, although Fa is def\nnot a fully dead project lol\n\nKay, so besides those, ari-web also has pages ig, like I don't think I can consider\nthem projects but yk, it's all in the main page kinda, actually a lot of it is indexed\nat <https://www.ari-web.xyz/page/90s> although I'd suggest not visiting it if you like\nhaving eyes\n\n## Tools\n\nI am a Linux user as of now, I usually work with Linux, although I try to be as friendly\nas possible towards other \\*NIX-like operating systems, examples being BSD and MacOS,\nmainly BSD though as I myself got plans for 2023 to switch to it, Linux is getting too\nmainstream and large for my taste, although most likely I will still be using Linux\nis some form or another\n\nMy code editor is [ViM](https://www.vim.org/), a lightweight TUI code editor which is really extensible, vim\nis extremely fast and also has a very powerful plugin system using various languages (even compiled ones)\nbounded together by VimScript, there is another project called [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) which tries to improve\nmore things on it because vim is an extremely old project which is basically controlled by one person,\nalthough still many people contribute, NeoVim is more speed and community focused, although I prefer ViM\nbecause I don't need the extra features and improvements nvim brings with it\n\nMy main interpreted language is Python, a very powerful, abstract high level programming language,\nalso quite powerful with its ability to load C and C++ extensions for lower level access, its API\nis fairly simple, you just work with basic PyObjects\n\nMy main compiled languages are C and C++, as I'm not a huge fan of OOP and I barely find use\nfor it, I mainly use C++ for its type system and namespaces, I also like C, a very simple\nand small programming language with low level access to the point of assembly, one thing which\nI don't really like about C is that you basically work with raw pointers all the time, C++\nmakes it less of a pain in my opinion\n\nFor configuration languages I prefer JSON, JSONC or DOSINI, all of them have their own uses,\nbut one works better than others in certain cases, JSON works well for basic config with\nmultiple types, JSONC works better for bigger and more complex configuration and DOSINI\npretty much works on anything that uses repositories or needs a basic header-key-value\nconfig, like `{\"header\": {\"key\": \"value\"}}` is a much more painful syntax than just\n\n    [header]\n    key = value\n\nAlso we cannot live without scripts, they help up automate repetitive tasks like building\na C++ binary with a whole bunch of flags, Makefiles are cool, but quite painful, also I use 4 spaces\nrather than tabs (yes ik so controversial smh how dare I wasted space blah blah blah) and Makefiles\nforce you to use tabs, which is extremely annoying, so I just resort to using POSIX sh and in very\nvery very rare cases where I need to use more special features I use BASH\n\nMy web stack for frontend is mainly (S)CSS, JS and HTML, although I like TS more, usually\nI'm just too lazy to set it up and end up running into countless bugs just because of people's beloved\nJavaScript (+ other million languages that have 'Java' in their name but have nothing in common with java),\nSCSS is also not a rare thing for me to use, it just requires some transpiling and you get way more features\nthan in CSS, I mainly use it in styles that require me to use a central configuration file or I just need\nthose extra features, for backend I usually use python with the flask web framework and jinja templating\nengine, if I need it also an SQLite3 database using SQLAlchemy because we all know how amazing, enjoyable and secure\nit is to write raw SQL queries <3333, this is a joke for the ones that don't get sarcasm\n\nThe languages I mentioned is not all I know, I have tried many languages, some of them liked,\nsome of them meh, same with knowledge of them, some of them I know better than others,\nfor example racket, scheme. haskell, lua, ruby, chicken, etc. and languages I really didn't\ninclude and which didn't fit like markdown, roff, etc. (which are not *programming* languages)\nI still use them\n\nAnd finally some random things I use can be found on <https://blog.ari-web.xyz/b/my-gentoo-linux-setup/>\n\nThank you for listening to my presentation about this,\nhave a nice rest of your day\n",

      "content": "So you know how everyone hates every temperature system?\nWhy not make the most ~~painful~~ best one? I did it, I call it torture,\nits measurement unit is T, this the formula for it:\n\n    cos((((C + 273.15) + C + ((C * (9 / 5) + 32))) / 3) + \u03c0) + e\n\nWhere C is temperature in Celcius, in this system precision in\nfloating points is **_VERY_** important because yes\n\nHere's a python implementation of it:\n\n    import math\n\n    def t(c: int) -> float:\n        return math.cos((((c + 273.15) + c + ((c * (9/5) + 32))) / 3) + math.pi) + math.e\n\nWhere argument c is temperature in Celcius, this function\nwill give you the most accurate results it can in python, in\nthis system you must specify at least 6 digits of precision\n\nSome basic examples:\n\n- 100 Celcius, the boiling point of water: 3.2975788083579793 \u00b0T\n- 0 Celcius, the freezing point of water: 2.3426350414279824 \u00b0T\n- 17 Celcius, the current temperature for me: 3.4648639877740215 \u00b0T\n\n## How does this shit work?\n\nIt takes the average of most major temperature units --\nKelvin, Celcius and Fahrenheit, then it adds pi to it and consines\nthe result, after that it adds e and boom we got degrees torture,\nfairly simple\n\nAnyway, now enjoy this amazing system of temperature, if you get\nhotter than 3.0975306904597475 \u00b0T make sure to take a rest from\nthis\n\nGoodbye :)\n",

Python does a lot\nmore than this under the hood, it calls loads of syscalls just for that\nprogram alone:\n\n    ari@ari-gentoo ~ % strace python3 hello_world.py 2>&1 | wc -l\n    754\n\nAnd these are only the syscalls, imagine the control flow, there are probably\nmany jumps, complicated loops and generally, if we theoretically generated a CFG\nfor python it'd probably be huge and extremely complicated, this is the reason\nwhy it's **_not simple_**, in logic it does much more than we tell it to,\npython isn't explicit so it makes it very **_easy_** to write\n\nNow, let's write the same program in x86_64 Linux FASM Assembly:\n\n    format ELF64 executable 3\n    segment readable executable\n\n    _start:\n        mov rax, 1\n        mov rdi, 1\n        mov rsi, hello\n        mov rdx, hello_len\n        syscall\n\n        mov rax, 60\n        mov rdi, 0\n        syscall\n\n    segment readable\n        hello: db \"Hello world\", 10\n        hello_len = $ - hello\n\nNow this is where the fight would begin after I mention \"easy != simple\",\nbecause they have an opinion of \"Less code = simple\", this code is **_simple_**\nbelieve me or not, this code is just **_not easy_**, for a average virgin JavaScript\nor some high-level language developer this code seems overly complicated and\nthey call this code \"Not simple\", when it actually is very simple, it's just\nagain, as I mentioned, not easy.\n\nSo if we compile it and run this binary:\n\n    ari@ari-gentoo ~ % fasm hello_world.asm\n    flat assembler  version 1.73.30  (16384 kilobytes memory, x64)\n    3 passes, 234 bytes.\n\n    ari@ari-gentoo ~ % strace ./hello_world 2>&1 | wc -l\n    5\n\nSee how much simpler this is, it's only 5 lines of strace output and it's\nactually faster because of the simplicity of this program\n\nPython takes `0:00.05` seconds where as assembly takes `0:00.00` seconds,\nsimplicity not only improves the performance, it improves how much\nyour program needs in resources, python does much much more meaning it needs\na lot more memory, CPU and storage to run\n\nSo basically, simplicity is not ease, ease is what you do and simplicity\nis what your program does, easy as that, hopefully I clarified what I mean\nby \"Simple != easy\" and hopefully I won't need to explain it again :)\n\nHave a nice rest of your day and I hope you now understand what is the difference\nbetween easy and simple :D\n",

Visits for example\n\nAnyway, if anyone is unhappy with this change you can just\n[email me](mailto:ari.web.xyz@gmail.com), [leave an issue under the git repo](/git) or [leave a comment in the users CaO](https://user.ari-web.xyz/)\n\nAnyway, thank you people for staying with me, hope\nari-web continues to grow as both a personal portfolio\nand just a fun site :)\n\nHave a nice rest of your day :D\n",

Wouldn't they make LGBT people\nmore accepted, even though this would save not a huge ammount of people but it'd probably\nstill be _something_ at least I guess, why don't we first climb the human rights ranking\nand then expect some results instead of screaming how people are immigrating to other\ncounties like Norway and say \"They're stealing children from Lithuania\", first\nmake those children feel accepted in the country, then complain.\n\nAnyway, quite disapointing how \"movements\" such as this exist and then complain about\nhow Lithuania is shrinking, goddamn, why did I have to be born in Lithuania lmao,\nbut at least better than some other countries ig?\n",

From what they wear to how they\nspend their free time, Adventurers act in ways that vividly reflect\nwho they are as unique individuals.\n\nAnd every Adventurer is certainly unique. Driven by curiosity and\neager to try new things, people with this personality often have a\nfascinating array of passions and interests. With their exploratory\nspirits and their ability to find joy in everyday life, Adventurers\ncan be among the most interesting people you\u2019ll ever meet.\nThe only irony? Unassuming and humble, Adventurers tend to see themselves\nas \u201cjust doing their own thing,\u201d so they may not even realize how\nremarkable they really are. The Beauty of an Open Mind.\n\nAdventurers embrace a flexible, adaptable approach to life. Some personality\ntypes thrive on strict schedules and routines \u2013 but not Adventurers.\nAdventurers take each day as it comes, doing what feels right to them in the moment.\nAnd they make sure to leave plenty of room in their lives for\nthe unexpected \u2013 with the result that many of their most cherished memories\nare of spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment outings and adventures, whether by themselves\nor with their loved ones.\n\nThis flexible mindset makes Adventurers remarkably tolerant and open-minded.\nThese personalities genuinely love living in a world filled with all kinds of\npeople \u2013 even people who disagree with them or choose radically different lifestyles.\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that Adventurers are unusually open to changing their minds\nand rethinking their opinions. If any personality type believes in giving something\n(or someone) a second chance, it\u2019s Adventurers. Adventurers want to live in a\nworld where they \u2013 and everyone else \u2013 have the freedom to live as they see fit,\nwithout judgment.\n\nThat said, Adventurers\u2019 go-with-the-flow mentality can have its downsides.\nPeople with this personality type may struggle to set long-term\nplans \u2013 let alone stick with them. As a result, Adventurers tend to have a\npretty cloudy view of their ability to achieve their goals, and they often\nworry about letting other people down. Adventurers may find that adding\na little structure to their lives goes a long way toward helping them feel\nmore capable and organized \u2013 without quashing their independent spirits.\nLiving in Harmony.\n\nIn their relationships, Adventurers are warm,friendly, and caring, taking\nwholehearted enjoyment in the company of their nearest and dearest. But\nmake no mistake: this is an Introverted personality type, meaning that\nAdventurers need dedicated alone time to recharge their energy after socializing\nwith others. This alone time is what allows Adventurers to reestablish a\nsense of their own identity \u2013 in other words, to reconnect with who they truly are.\nUnless they take time for themselves, Adventurers can end up feeling lost in\nthe tide of everyday life, constantly reacting to external circumstances\ninstead of making their own way.\n\nCreative and free-spirited, Adventurers march to the beat of their own drum,\nand it would be easy to assume that they don\u2019t particularly worry what other\npeople think of them. But this isn\u2019t the case \u2013 Adventurers are thoughtful\nand perceptive, able to pick up on people\u2019s unspoken feelings and opinions,\nand it can upset them if they don\u2019t feel liked, approved of, or appreciated.\nWhen faced with criticism, it can be a challenge for people with this personality\ntype not to get caught up in the heat of the moment. If they encounter harsh\nor seemingly unfair criticism, they may even lose their tempers in spectacular fashion.\n\nBut there\u2019s good news, too: Adventurers live in the present, and they know\nthat they don\u2019t need to dwell on past hurts or frustrations. Rather than focusing\non how things could be different, people with this personality type have an\nincredible capacity for appreciating what\u2019s right about life just as it is.\nEverywhere they look, Adventurers can find sources of beauty and enjoyment that\nother people might miss \u2013 and this perspective is just one of the many\ngifts that they share with the world.\n",

      "content": "Today I was challenged to make a program in C,\nassembly and then pure ELF-64, I chose a\n[\"Hello world\" program](https://wikiless.tiekoetter.com/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program?lang=en),\nand so, I wrote a program in C, then in (NASM x86_64 Linux) assembly and then,\nwell pure ELF-64, Firstly I made a C program to generate the program, I took the\nbytes of it and put it into python...\n\nThen I made a GitHub repo: <https://github.com/TruncatedDinosour/low-hello-world>\n\nBut before that I compiled the ones I needed to and the results shocked me:\n\n- C89 (GCC, stripped): `14KB` [`gcc -std=c89 -s hello_world.c`]\n- Assembly (NASM, stripped): `8.3KB` [`nasm -felf64 hello_world.asm -s && ld -o a.out hello_world.o -s`]\n\nAnd the one that shocked me the most:\n\n- Pure ELF-64: `166B`\n\nAnd that made me think, is assembly... Bloated?\nThe difference is HUGE and they do the same think,\nit's so insane.\n\nSo now I got a project idea in mind, less Bloated assembly,\nbut [idk](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/idk-meaning/)...\n\nIt's so wild how going lower than low level can make\nsuch huge difference, but then again, with using assembly\nand assemblers like [NASM](https://nasm.us/) you get a lot\nmore features and stuff.\n\nBut with manual elf generation you get infinite control,\nwhich is nice.\n\nI know, you can probably [\"Shoot yourself in the foot\"](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/shoot-yourself-in-the-foot)\nby manually generating ELF but the amount of space you can save is crazy.\n\nDebugging will also be more painful with manually generating assembly,\nno sections and stuff, but it's still very interesting\n\nAnyway, conclusion, rust is bloated, assembly is bloated,\neverything is bloated, the lower you go the less bloat you\nget apparently, it's nice :)\n\nBut besides that, assembly is still great, C is great, rust... Not\nso much but whatever, don't stop using it because \"Ari said it's bloated\",\nit's more than okay to use them, still very shocking results, assembly\nruns and will always run everything and you can't do anything about that\ngenerating ELF gave me like 947 mental illnesses so I think I will\nstay with assembly, but I will consider making less bloated assembly lol\n\nAnyway, thanks for listening to me, sorry if I offended anyone,\nthis wasn't my intention, just sharing the results lol :)\n\nSee you in the next blog, have a good rest of your day :)\n",
